## List
1. $f(x)=k, f'(x)=0$ **Constants don't change**
2. $f(x)=x, f'(x)=1$ [[Power Rule#Power Rule|Power Rule]] / **Change of X per change of X is 1**
3. $f(x)=k \cdot g(x), f'(x)=k\cdot g'(x)$ **Constants Scale the Derivative**
4. $f(x)=p(x)\pm g(x), f'(x)=p'(x)\pm q'(x)$ [[Chain Rule#Addition|Chain Rule]] **Derivative of sum is sum of derivative**
5. $f(x)=p(x)\cdot q(x), f'(x)=f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)$ [[Chain Rule#Multiplication|Chain Rule]]
6. $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)},f'(x)=\frac{p'(x)q(x)-p(x)q'(x)}{q(x)^{2}}$ [[Quotient Rule#Quotient Rule|Quotient Rule]]
7. $f(x)=p(x)^{n}, f'(x)=n\cdot p(x)^{n-1}\cdot p'(x)$ [[Power Rule#Power Rule|Power]] and [[Chain Rule#Function Composition|Chain Rule]] 
8. $f(x)=p(q(x)), f'(x)=p'(q(x))\cdot q'(x)$ [[Chain Rule#Function Composition|Chain Rule]] **Function Composition**
9. $f(x)=b^{x},f'(x) = b^{x}\ln{b}$ [[Derivatives of Exponentials#Derivatives of Exponentials|Exponential Rule]] 
10. $f(x)=\log_{b}{x}, f'(x)=\frac{1}{\ln{b}x}$ [[Derivatives of Exponentials#Derivatives of Logarithms|Logarithm Rule]]
