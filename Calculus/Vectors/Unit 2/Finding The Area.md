# Finding The Area
## Parallelogram
Treat 2 sides as vectors
The area is a the [[Vectors#Magnitude|Magnitude]] of the [[Cross Product]] of the 2 vectors
## Triangle
The **same** as finding it for the [[#Parallelogram]] but **divided by 2**
## Volume of a Parallelepiped
To find it you multiply the area of the base by the height
### Finding the Height
you project the other vector onto the cross product of the 2 base vectors.
