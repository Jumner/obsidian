# Algebraic [[Vectors]]
---
They are like normal [[Vectors|Geometric Vectors]] and still have [[Vectors#Direction|Direction]] and [[Vectors#Magnitude|Magnitude]]
Instead of being fully represented by these [[Vectors#Direction|Direction]], they are represented as a ([[#X]],[[#Y]],[[#Z]]) **point** using **Coordinates**. 
The [[Vectors#^61c47d|Directed Line Segment]] is drawn from the **origin** (0,0,0) to the tip ([[#X]],[[#Y]],[[#Z]])
## Dimensionality
### One Dimensional Vectors
Can be represented on a single line

### Two Dimensional Vector
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$  Space (**Two real numbers**)
Can be represented on a plane
Angle $\theta$ is measured **counter clockwise** from the [[#X|X Axis]] to the vector
All 2d Vectors can be represented by a linear combination of the [[#Base vectors]]
$$\vec{v} = (1,2) = \hat{i} \cdot 1 + \hat{j} \cdot2$$
## Components
The components of a [[Vectors|Vector]] are what consists of the **coordinates**
The components of Vector $\vec{v} = [0,0]$ 

## Notation
### [[#One Dimensional Vectors]]
$\vec{v} = [-23]$
### [[#Two Dimensional Vector]]
$\mathbb{R}^{2}= \mathbb{R} \cdot \mathbb{R} = \{(x, y)| x,y \in \mathbb{R}\}$   
#### Ordered Pair Notation
$$\vec{v} = (x,y)$$
#### [[#Base vectors|Unit Vector Notation]] 
$$\vec{v} = \hat{i}\cdot x + \hat{j}\cdot y$$
#### [[Vectors#Magnitude|Magnitude]]
$|\vec{v}| = |\overrightarrow{0p}| = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}$ 
#### [[Vectors#Direction|Angle]] $\theta$ 
$$tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x} \therefore \theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$$

# Base vectors
## X
The **X** (**$\hat{i}$**) [[Vectors#Unit vector|Unit Vector]]  points towards you
## Y
The **Y** (**$\hat{j}$**) [[Vectors#Unit vector|Unit Vector]]  points to the right
## Z
The **Z** (**$\hat{k}$**) [[Vectors#Unit vector|Unit Vector]]  points up
