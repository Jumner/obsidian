## Solving Algebraically
Put the Line in [[Parametric Equations#Plane In mathbb R 3 Space|Parametric Form]] and the Plane in [[Cartesian Equations#Planes In mathbb R 3 Space|Cartesian Form]]. **Sub the line into the plane** and **solve for t**. Sub t to find a point on the line. **Sub the point into the plane** to check for intercept
## X,Y,Z Intercepts
x-int, set y,z=0
y-int, set x,z=0
z-int, set x,y=0
This **always** gives 3 [[Points]]
