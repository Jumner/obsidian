# Vector
Vectors have both [[#Direction]] and [[#Magnitude]]. 
## Direction
Where the [[#Vector]] points to.
## Magnitude
The length of the vector. Independent of [[#Direction]]
Represented by a single number
## Examples
> Velocity, displacement, force, weight, force
## Geometry
Geometrically, they can be expressed as a line segment with an arrow. This is called a **directed** line segment.
## Notation
Vectors are written with an arrow over top
$$\overrightarrow {AB}$$
### Magnitude
The absolute of the vector
$$\left | \vec{v} \right |$$
### Direction
What direction the vector is pointed.
### Parallel vectors
$$\vec v\, \textbackslash\textbackslash\, \vec u$$
### Unit vectors
Unit vectors are notated with a hat
$$\hat v = \frac{\vec v}{\left| \vec v \right |}$$
Called **v hat**
> Note that a zero vector would require dividing by zero

#### True bearing
> Measured from due north. Measured going counter clockwise
#### Conventional Bearing
> Angle between 2 closest marks. Example, N 30 deg E -> Start at north go 30 degrees towards east
#### Tail to tail
> The angle between 2 vector placed tail to tail
## Equal / Equivilent vectors
Vectors are equal when their [[#Direction|Directions]] and [[#Magnitude|Magnitudes]] are equal
## Opposite vectors
Vectors are opposite when their [[#Direction|Directions]] are opposite and their [[#Magnitude|Magnitudes]] are equal
## Parallel / Collinear Vectors
Vectors are **collinear** when their [[#Direction|Directions]] are either the **same** or **opposite**.
> [[#Magnitude]] is not important
## Zero vector
The zero vector has a [[#Magnitude]] of **zero** and **Not Defined** [[#Direction]]
## Unit vector
A vector with a [[#Magnitude]] of **1**. The [[#Direction]] is not important
Every [[#Vector]] has a [[#Unit vector]] besides a [[#Zero vector]]. See [[#Unit vectors|Explanation]]

## Multiplying and Dividing by [[Scalers#Scaler|Scaler]]
The [[#Direction]] is unchanged but the [[#Magnitude]] is scaled
$$-\vec v = -1 \cdot \vec v$$
