## Time Dilation
> When something goes close to the speed of light, time passes slower so that light is the same speed for both an internal observer and a "stationary" observer.
> Imagine a rocket going 90% the speed of light. The light that goes off the from will appear to slowly crawl along. For it to still be the speed of light, time passes 10x faster for that internal observer.

### B's Perspective
D is the distance covered by one iteration of the clock
d is the distance light travels
L is the vertical distance
v is the velocity of B
> $$\begin{align}
D&=vt, d=\frac{ct}{2}\\
d^{2}&=L^{2}+(\frac{D}{2})^{2}\\
(\frac{ct}{2})^{2}&=L^{2}+(\frac{vt}{2})^{2}\\
c^{2}f^{2}&=4L^{2}+v^{2}t^{2}\\
t^{2}(c^{2}-v^{2})&=4L^{2}\\
t&=\frac{2L}{c\sqrt{1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\end{align}$$
### A's Perspective (Stationary)
>$$\begin{align}
t&=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\end{align}$$

## What Is 0
> The 0 in $t_{0}$ is the time **relative** to **what is being measured**
> So if you are in a ship watching something on earth, the $t_{0}$ is the earth time and $t$ is the ship time.
