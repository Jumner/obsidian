# The Special Theory Of Relativity
---
1. What is an inertial frame of reference?
   >An inertial frame of reference is one in which the laws of motion are valid. In an inertial frame of reference, an object will maintain a state of motion as long as there is no net force.
2. Give several examples of inertial frames of reference.
   >- A car on a straight, level highway
   >- A train moving at a constant speed on a level track
   >- An airplane cruising at a constant altitude and speed
   >- A person standing still
   >- A person walking at a constant speed in a straight line
3. List the three important statements about relative motion and frames of reference. These statements form the basis for The Special Theory of Relativity.
   >- In an inertial frame of reference, an object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or moving in a straight line with a constant speed.
   >- The laws of Newtonian mechanics are only valid in an inertial frame of reference.
   >- The laws of Newtonian mechanics apply equally in all inertial frames of reference; in other words, all inertial frames of reference are equivalent as far as adherence to the laws of mechanics is concerned.
4. Define a non-inertial frame of reference.
   > A non-inertial frame of reference is defined as a frame of reference in which Newton's laws of motion do not hold. In a non-inertial frame of reference, there are fictitious forces that arise due to the acceleration of the frame.
5. What interesting phenomenon follows from the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference? (pg 564 The Top of The page)
   > In Newtonian physics, there is no such thing as absolute velocity. You can only measure your velocity relative to your frame of reference. This is seen when throwing a ball in a moving car or standing still. The ball will behave the same in your frame of reference.
6. Give a simple example of vector addition of velocities.
   > If you are driving a car at 60 km/h and you pass a car going 80 km/h relative to the car in the same direction, then your velocity is 140 km/hour.
7. What was missing from J.C. Maxwells prediction of the velocity of light? What was hypothesized to support Maxwells theory? Describe this thing.
   > J.C. Maxwell's prediction of the velocity of light was missing the idea of a medium that could support electromagnetic waves. This medium, now known as the aether, was thought to be necessary to explain how electromagnetic waves could propagate through empty space, leading to an absolute frame of reference.
8. What was The purpose of The Michelson-Morley experiment?
   > The Michelson-Morley experiment was an attempt to detect the presence of the aether, which was believed to be the medium through which light waves propagated. The experiment was unable to detect the presence of the aether, which led to the conclusion that the aether did not exist. This in turn led to the development of the theory of relativity, which did not require the existence of the aether.
9. Briefly describe The operating principles (method) of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
   > The Michelson-Morley experiment was an attempt to measure the speed of the aether. It used a device called a Michelson interferometer, which is a device that splits light into two beams and then recombines them. The experiment was designed to measure the difference in the speed of light in the two beams. It was suspected that there would be different readings at different angles allowing the velocity of the aether to be measured.
10. What was The result of The Michelson-Morley experimentâ€˜?
  > The experiment failed to find any difference in the speed of light, which led to the conclusion that the speed of light is the same in all directions and there is no aether.
11. State the two postulates of The Special Theory of Relativity. Why is the second postulate difficult To accept?
  > 1. The relativity principle: all the laws of physics are valid in all inertial frames of reference.
  > 2. The constancy of the speed of light: light travels through empty space with a speed of c = $3.0\cdot10^{8}$ m/s, relative to all inertial frames of reference.
  > The second postulate of special relativity is difficult to accept because it contradicts our everyday experience. It states that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. This means that **there is no absolute frame of reference**. However, we often think of there being an absolute frame of reference, such as the ground or the center of the universe. For a simple example to show this seeming contradiction, imagine standing still and watching a car go by. The light emitted by the headlights is going at the **same velocity** relative to **Both** observers. This seems extremely counter intuitive. The solution is that time passes slower for the observer in the car which explains how this is possible but is no more intuitive.
