> $$m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
> This also creates relativistic momentum
> $$mv=\frac{m_{0}v}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^2}}}$$
## But Why Tho
> Since the derivation is wack, heres a way to understand this
> 
> as you get closer to the speed of light, your mass appears to increase. 
> This increase of mass makes it harder to accelerate making it impossible to reach the speed of light
