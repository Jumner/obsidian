# Mass And Energy
---
> Using the classic $E=mc^{2}$ equation, you can tell that energy can be converted to mass and vice versa
> This principle is used by [[#Fission]] and [[#Fusion]]
> $E=mc^{2}$ is a combination of conservation of mass and conservation of energy

## Fission
$\ce{U -> Kr + Ba + n}$ 
> When a heavy element splits into 2 lighter elements
> **Mass is actually lost** here and is **converted to energy**
## Fusion
$\ce{4H -> He}$
> When 2 or more lighter elements fuse into a heavier element
> **Mass is also lost** here and is **converted to energy**
## Rest Energy
> Rest energy is the energy $E_{0}=m_{0}c^{2}$ measured relative to an object
> 
## Relativistic Energy
> When moving at relativistic speeds $E=mc^{2}, m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$

## Kinetic Energy
>$E-E_{0}=E_{k}$
>$mc^{2}-m_{0}c^{2}=E_{k}$
>$E_{k}=(m-m_{0})c^{2}$

## Electron Volts
> Measure of energy, $1\text{eV}=1.60\cdot10^{-16}\text{J}$
