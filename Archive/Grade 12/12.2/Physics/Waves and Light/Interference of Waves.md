# Interference of Waves
---
A point source emits waves in a circle (like ripples in a lake).
When 2 point sources are close together. They form lines of interference
## Nodal Line
A nodal line is the line formed by [[Waves#Destructive Interference|Destructive Interference]] 
If you measure the distances between the 2 points and a point on the 1st Nodal Line. The difference between them will always be $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$. The second line will have a distance of $1 \frac{1}{2}\lambda$. Therefore, the distance for nodal line $n$ is always $(n-\frac{1}{2})\lambda$

## Path Difference
> $|PS_{1}-PS_{2}|$
The difference in the distance that each wave travels to reach a point. If this difference is a multiple of the wavelength, they will [[Waves#Constructive Interference|Constructively Interfere]]. If they are off by a half wavelength, they will [[Waves#Destructive Interference|Destructively Interfere]] and create a [[#Nodal Line]].
### Wack
$$\begin{align}
\sin{\theta}&=(n-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\\
\sin{\theta}&= \frac{x_{n}}{L}\\
\frac{x_{n}}{L}&= \frac{(n-\frac{1}{2})\lambda}{d}\\
\lambda&= \frac{x_{n}d}{(n-\frac{1}{2})L}
\end{align}$$
You get these 4 equations
$$\begin{align}
\lambda&=\frac{|PS_{1}-PS_{2}|}{n-\frac{1}{2}}\\
\sin{\theta}&=(n-\frac{1}{2})\lambda\\
\sin{\theta}&= \frac{x_{n}}{L}\\
\lambda&= \frac{x_{n}d}{(n-\frac{1}{2})L}
\end{align}$$
