# End Reflections
---
> When a wave reflects off an end

## Fixed End Reflections
> With a fixed end, the wave will come back and **invert**

## Free End Reflections
> With a free end, the wave will come back and **not invert**

## Change of Median
> When a median changes, the wave will reflect like a [[#Fixed End Reflections|Fixed End Reflection]] and will **transmit unchanged through the new median**.
