# Waves
---
> A transfer of energy by means of disturbance. **[[#Light|Usually]]** through a medium.
![[Energy and Frequency#Photon Frequency]]
## Light
> Does not require a medium
## Transverse Wave
> Has a wavelength (The length from [[#Peak]] to [[#Peak]], or [[#Trough]] to [[#Trough]])

### Wavelength
![[Electromagnetic Radiation#Wavelength]]
#### Universal Wave Equation
$v=\lambda f, \lambda=\frac{v}{f}$ 
### Amplitude
The max amplitude of a wave
Can be found with the height of the [[#Peak]]
### Peak
> The **highest point** in the wave. It's height is the [[#Amplitude]]
> Also known as a Crest
### Trough
> The **lowest point** in the wave.
> Also known as a Valley

## Longitudinal Wave
> Also known as a **Pressure wave** or **Compression wave**
> Sound is a great example
> Still has a

## Wave Collisions
> Waves collide their positions are added. 
> They can interfere [[#Constructive Interference|Constructively]] or [[#Destructive Interference|Destructively]].

### Destructive Interference
> When the sum of the waves have a lower amplitude, they have **destructively interfered**
#### Node
>A node is a stationary point caused by [[#Destructive Interference]]
Seen in [[#Standing Wave]] ![[#Standing Wave]]
### Constructive Interference
> When the sum of the waves has a higher amplitude, they have **Constructively interfered**

#### Antinode
> The opposite of a node caused by [[#Constructive Interference]]
seen in [[#Standing Wave]] ![[#Standing Wave]]
## Standing Wave
A wave that appears stationary
