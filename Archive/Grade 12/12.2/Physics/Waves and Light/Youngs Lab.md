# Young's Experiment
---
### **<u>Purpose:</u>**
To study the pattern of the light produced when it passes through double slits and determine the wavelengths read and blue light.
### **<u>Apparatus:</u>**
- Double slit card
- Showcase
- Red and blue filters
- Meter stick
- Neon laser
### **<u>Procedure and Observations:</u>**
1. View the write filament through the double slit from a distance of about 3.0m or more. Describe ***in detail*** the interference pattern you see:
 > The interference pattern that was observed is **a series of rainbows** emanating from the bulb. These rainbows have violet closer to the bulb and red farther away. This creates the rainbow effect.  Each rainbow also is spread farther apart than the last.

2. View the light source when covered first with a red filter, then with a blue filter. Stand *<u>about</u>* 3.0m from the light. You must be able to see the bands. While one partner looks through the slits, the other partner spans the interference pattern with their fingers under the direction of the first partner. Complete the chart below.

### **<u>Observations:</u>**
**Table 1:** *Measured And Calculated Values*

|                                  | Red                      | Blue                     | Laser                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Number of bright bands used      | 5                        | 5                        | 17                        |
| Span of interference pattern (m) | 0.231                    | 0.165                    | 0.324                     |
| Average $\Delta x$ (m)           | $\frac{0.231}{4}=0.0578$ | $\frac{0.165}{4}=0.0413$ | $\frac{0.324}{16}=0.0203$ |
| Distance between slits 'd' (m)   | $3.25\cdot10^{-5}$       | $3.25\cdot10^{-5}$       | $3.25\cdot10^{-5}$        |
| Viewing Distance 'L' (m)                                 |3.0                          |3.0                          |1.0                           |
|Calculated Wavelength (nm)                                  |~626                          |~447                          |~658                           |

**\* Note:** Wavelength values are approximate because only 2 significant digits can be guaranteed.

#### Sample Calculation
$$\begin{align}
\lambda&=\frac{d \Delta x}{L}\\
\lambda&=\frac{3.25\cdot10^{-5}\cdot0.0578}{3.0}\\
\lambda&=6.3\cdot10^{-7}\text{ m}=6.3\cdot10^{2}\text{ nm}
\end{align}$$

### **<u>Questions:</u>**
Answer the following questions in complete sentences.

1. Describe mow your calculated values for the wavelength of red and blue light agree with the accepted ranges of these colours
> **Table 2:** *The Visible Light Spectrum*
>
| **Colour** | **Wavelength (nm)** |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Violet     | 400-450             |
| Blue       | 450-500             |
| Green      | 500-570             |
| Yellow     | 570-590             |
| Orange     | 590-610             |
| Red        | 610-750             |
> The calculated wavelengths agree with the accepted ranges.
> Red Lamp: The red lamp had a calculated wavelength of ~626nm which is in the range of red.
> Blue Lamp: The blue lamp had a calculated wavelength of ~447nm which is just 3nm into the range of violet. However this is super close and technically only 2 of digits are significant so it is unclear exactly which range it falls in. What is clear is that this difference would likely not even be detectable and would still look blue. 
> Red Laser: The red laser had a calculated wavelenth of ~658nm which is in the range of red.
> Overall, the calculated values do agree with the accepted ranges.

2. a.  How does the wavelength of the light affect $\Delta x$ value?
> According to Young's formula ($\Delta x=\frac{L \lambda}{d}$),$\Delta x \propto \lambda$. Because $\Delta x$ is proportional to the wavelength, the larger the wavelength, the larger the distance between the bright bands. Hence, smaller wavelengths have a smaller distance between bright bands.

b. Explain why the bands of the pattern are multicoloured when white light is viewed through the double slit and why you see the colours in a specific order.
> These <font color="#ff0000">r</font><font color="#ff8000">a</font><font color="#ffff00">i</font><font color="#00ff00">n</font><font color="#00ffff">b</font><font color="#0080ff">o</font><font color="#0000ff">w</font><font color="#8000ff">s</font> that are mentioned above are formed because like stated in question 2a, the distance between each band is proportional to the wavelength. This means that shorter wavelengths are closer to the bulb than longer wavelengths. This makes sense because violet is observed on the inside (meaning smallest $\Delta x$) and it has the shortest wavelength. Each band also gets progressively spread wider because the distance accumulates with each band.

3. Calculate the relative percentage error for the wavelength of the laser ( accepted value is 650nm ).
>$$\begin{align}
\%_{\text{err}}=100\%\frac{\text{measured}-\text{accepted}}{\text{accepted}}&=100\%\frac{658-650}{650}\\
&=1.3\%
\end{align}$$

4. Using the data in Table 2, calculate the frequency **range** for both red and blue light.

> Red:
> $$\begin{align}
\lambda&=\frac{v}{f},f=\frac{v}{\lambda}=\frac{c}{\lambda}\\
f_{1}&=\frac{c}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{3.00\cdot10^{8}}{610\cdot10^{-9}}=4.9\cdot10^{14}\text{ hz}\\
f_{2}&=\frac{c}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{3.00\cdot10^{8}}{750\cdot10^{-9}}=4.0\cdot10^{14}\text{ hz}
\end{align}$$
> $\therefore$ , the frequency of red light goes from $4.0\cdot10^{14}$ to $4.9\cdot10^{14}$ hz

> Blue:
> $$\begin{align}
\lambda&=\frac{v}{f},f=\frac{v}{\lambda}=\frac{c}{\lambda}\\
f_{1}&=\frac{c}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{3.00\cdot10^{8}}{450\cdot10^{-9}}=6.7\cdot10^{14}\text{ hz}\\
f_{2}&=\frac{c}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{3.00\cdot10^{8}}{500\cdot10^{-9}}=6.0\cdot10^{14}\text{ hz}
\end{align}$$
> $\therefore$ , the frequency of blue light goes from $6.0\cdot10^{14}$ to $6.7\cdot10^{14}$ hz

5. Without using google and just using concepts taught in this unit, explain why the maximum magnification power of a visible light microscope is only about 1000X.
> A wavelength of red light is $750\cdot10^{-9}\text{ m}$. at 1000X magnification it would "appear" to be $750\cdot10^{-9}\cdot10^{3}=7.5\cdot10^{-4}\text{ m}=0.75\text{ mm}$. In other words, at that magnification, **a wavelength of light appears to be almost a millimetre large**. This is an issue because the wavelengths of nearby objects can overlap and appear as one object. In essence, past around 1000X, everything will have kind of a rainbow blur as larger wavelengths are blurred more than shorter ones.
