# Tension
---
> Either $T$ or $\vec{F_{T}}$ 
> **Tension is always uniform along a string**

In this case, $T$ is the tension on the rope. It is a [[Scalers#Scaler|Scaler]]. $\vec{F_{T}}$ is the force imparted by [[#Tension]]. It is a [[Vectors#Vector|Vector]] and has [[Vectors#Direction|Direction]]

## Weight on a String Tied at 2 ends
1. Label the [[Free Body Diagrams#Free Body Diagrams|FBD]] 
2. Make a Triangle [[Vector Diagrams#Vector Diagrams|Vector Diagram]] and solve using **Sine Law**
## Tension in a moving system
> There is no tension in a rope if both the rope and its mass are falling off a cliff. 
$$\vec{F_{net}}=\vec{F_{gB}}+\vec{F_{T}}$$
you can just solve for $\vec{F_{T}}$

## Supporting Strings
> When a weight is supported by multiple strings, the force is distributed over each string. 

For example, 10N from a mass will create 5N of tension if split across 2 strings.
