### Allegory
>A narrative in which the **characters** and sometimes the **setting** represent general **concepts and ideas**.
>A **Specific example** used to teach a disconnected lesson (ex **tortoise and the hare**).
### Alliteration
>Draws attention to a string of words through **repetition of their initial sounds**.
>When the first letter (or sound) is repeated (usually at least 3 words)
### Allusion
> An indirect **reference** to a well-known event, person, thing, place, or quality.  By suggestion, it may enhance the significance of a poetic image or prose passage.
### Analogy
>Helps the reader understand **something unfamiliar** by comparing it to something well known. An extended metaphor.
### Anaphora
> Repetition of a word across multiple sentences
### Denotation
>Denotation is the thing or situation to which the word specifically refers (the dictionary definition); Connotation is the associated meanings it implies or suggests.
>Ex (Home denotes the place where a person lives, but connotes intimacy, privacy, and coziness).
### Hyperbole
> Exaduration to emphasizes a fact.
### Juxtaposition
>When two **opposing ideas**/images are placed **beside one another** to create a **contrasting effect**
### Imagery
>**Appeals to one or more of the senses** by creating a vivid impression through the use of concrete details, adjectives, and figures of speech – such as **[[#Metaphor]]**, **[[#Simile]]** and **[[#Personification]]**.
### Metaphor
>**Compares** two things **without the use of like or as**; it is more subtle than the **[[#Simile]]** and thus requires more interpretation.
### Onomatopoeia
>Draws attention to the sound of the word by imitating or suggesting **sounds that correspond to its meaning**.
>**Boom!, Pow!, Crack!,** etc...
### Oxymoron`
>Places words that mean the **opposite of one another side by side** so that they **create a new meaning**.
>Similar to **[[#Juxtaposition]]** except it creates meaning instead of creating **[[#Irony]]**
### Parallel Structure
>Parallel Structure (Parallelism) **repeats specific words, phrases, or clauses in a series**, giving emphasis to **key words** and making them memorable.
### Personification
>Gives **human traits** to an **inanimate object** or **animal**.
### Pun
>A Pun is a **play on words** with the **same sound but different meanings**.
### Repetition
>Used for **emphasis and rhythm**.
### Chiasmus
>**Reversals** (Chiasmus) make a balanced sentence **more memorable** by **repeating the words in reverse order**.
>A Rhetorical Question is one whose answer is already known or implied.
>“Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.”
### Rhyme
>Makes **two or more words memorable** by having **endings that sound the same**.
### Sentence Fragment
>Places emphasis on **keywords** to create an overall effect, such as humour or suspense.
### Simile
>Points out a similarity between two unlike things. Same as **[[#Metaphor]]** except is uses **like or as**.
### Symbol
>An object or action that **represents something** other than what it is.
### Understatement
>Understatement creates the reverse effect (and adds a touch of irony) by making the fact seem less significant.
>Opposite of **[[#Hyperbole]]**
### Irony
