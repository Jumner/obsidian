Reasons for [[Collision Geometry#Order of Reaction|Zero Order Reactant]]
- There could be too much of it (Like water in some reactions)

## Elementary Reactions
> A single step reaction
> $\ce{Ag+ + Cl- -> AgCl}, r=k[Ag^{+}][Cl^{-}]$
> Just use the coeffifcients
> $\ce{Ag+ + Cl- -> AgCl}, r=k[Ag]^{1}[Cl]^{1}$

## Molecularity
> Determines the order of an [[#Elementary Reactions|Elementary Reaction]] 
> - Unimolecular (1st Order) A -> Products, r = k[A]
> - Bimolecular (2nd Order) A + B -> Products, r = k$[A][B]$
> 	- 2A -> Products r = k[A]$^{2}$
> - Termolecular (3rd Order) A + B + C -> Products k$[A][B][C]$

## Multistep Reactions
$\ce{\cancel2NO2 -> NO3 + \cancel{NO}}$ Slow
$\ce{\cancel{NO} + CO -> \cancel{NO2} + CO2}$ Fast
$\ce{NO2 + CO -> NO3 + CO2}$  Speed of 1
> The reaction is only as fast as the slowest step
> So the concentration of the fastest step will matter far less
> $\ce{4HBr + O2 -> 2H2O + 2Br}, r=k[\ce{HBr}][\ce{O2}]$

## Surface Area
### Heterogeneous System
> Reactants have different states
> Surface are is super important
> $\text{Rate} \propto \text{Surface Area}$
> $\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}= \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} = \frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}}$
> $a_{1}t_{1}=a_{2}t_{2}$
> $\frac{6\cdot10}{a_{2}}=\frac{60}{60}=1\text{min}$
### Homogeneous System
> Reactants have the same state
>
