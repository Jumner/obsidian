#Thermodynamics 
# Temperature
> Increasing the temperature increases the energy of collisions so a higher \% of collisions have enough energy to start the reaction.
> Reaction rate usually **doubles every 10$\degree$c**

## Maxwell Boltzman Distribution
> A distribution of temperature ([[Energy#Kinetic Energy]]) in a gas.

Determines what **percentage** of molecules are past the [[#Activation Energy]]

## Activation Energy
> [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]] $E_{a}$, Once overcome, will convert the **potential energy** to [[Energy#Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]] and [[Thermochemistry#Endothermic|Vice Versa]].
> The **Greater** the [[#Activation Energy]], the **Lower** the reaction **rate** 
> Reactions are **likely spontaneous** if **$E_{a}<20$ kJ/mol**

## Flipping It
Flipping the graph will flip the sign of $\Delta H$
though the energy required for a reaction to go **doesn't change** (The activation Complex), the energy required to [[#Activation Energy|get it there]] does.
## Intermediates

The limiting step is the one with the **highest** [[#Activation Energy]].
$\ce{A -> B}$ Slow
$\ce{B->C}$ Fast
$\ce{A->C}$ Net
Rate = $k[A]$
