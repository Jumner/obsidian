#Equilibrium
# Equilibrium
---
>  All Reactions **Can** occur in forward and in reverse
>  we show this using the double arrow $\ce{<=>}$ which shows that the reaction occurs in both directions at the same time.
## Spontaneous Reaction
>  $>$ 99% of products are produced
>  Doesn't need much energy
## Dynamic Equilibrium
A "balance" of reversible processes.
### Chemical Reaction Equilibrium
There is a "balance" between the forward and reverse reactions
#### Characteristics of Systems at Equilibrium
1. The system is [[Thermochemistry#Closed System|Closed]]
2. The **Forward** reaction rate = the **Reverse** reaction rate
3. The concentration of **Reactants** and **Products** are constant
4. **Temperature** and **Pressure** remain **constant**
5. The same state of equilibrium is reached by starting with either **products** or **reactants**
### Phase Equilibrium
A chemical can be changing between **2 states** to reach an equilibrium.
#### Example
Water in a sealed beaker water is **evaporating** and **condensing** at the same rate.
## Factors That Determine State of Equilibrium
There are 2 possibilities, They work together or they don't.
- If they line up, the reactions are [[#Spontaneous Reaction|Spontaneous]]
	- Single -> arrows are used.
- If they don't, there is a **mixture**
	- Either no Reaction or equilibrium ($\ce{<=>>}$)
### Potential Energy [[Thermochemistry#Enthalpy|Enthalpy]] 
> Systems try to minimize [[Thermochemistry#Enthalpy|Enthalpy]] (**Potential energy** (Not the same))
> The reason that they are treated as the same is that when **Kinetic Energy** is released, **it escapes**. This allows more energy to be released and it's a cycle. It just appears from the outside like it favours minimum kinetic energy.
Because of this, it will favour [[Thermochemistry#Exothermic|Exothermic]] reactions
### Entropy
> Systems try to Maximize [[Entropy#Entropy|Entropy]] (Chaos)
> The more moles of substance that are active, the **higher** the [[#Entropy]]
> **Solids** have **lower** [[#Entropy]] than **liquids** and **gasses**
