#Equilibrium 
# Buffer
---
> A buffer is a solution with a [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acid]], or a [[Weak Bases#Weak Bases|Weak Base]], containing their [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugates]]. This creates a more gradual [[Titrations#Titration Curve|Titration Curve]] because the weak acid will **slowly disassociate** over the whole [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]] range. This effect is most significant at a [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]] of 7.

## Buffer Capacity
> A buffer can only absorb so much before it runs out and allows the displacement to take full effect.
## Buffer Region
> The region where a buffer effect is active. For a weak acid, this is at the bottom left of a [[Titrations#Titration Curve|Titration Curve]].
## pKa
> pKa is the [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]] in the center of the [[#Buffer Region]] or [[Titrations#Equivalence Point|Half The Equivalence Point]].
## pKb
> pKb is the [[pH and pOH#pOH|pOH]] in the center of the [[#Buffer Region]] or [[Titrations#Equivalence Point|Half The Equivalence Point]].
