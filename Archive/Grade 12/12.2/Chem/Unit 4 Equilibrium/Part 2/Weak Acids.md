#Equilibrium 
# Weak Acids
---
> A weak acid is one that does not fully disassociate its hydrogen's.
> These are often organic acids but also include $\ce{HF_{(aq)}}$ 
## Finding Ionization %
> To find the ionization % all you do is divide the concentration of [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Base]] by the concentration of the acid. You will often use [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]].
> **Decreases** as concentration **increases**

## Acid Ionization Constant
> There is an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] between the [[Acids And Bases#Acids|Acid]] and its [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Base]] 
> $$K_{a}=\frac{[\ce{CB-}][\ce{H3O+}]}{[\ce{A}]}$$
> A - [[Acids And Bases#Acids|Acid]] 
> CB - [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Base]]
> The **larger the $K_{a}$**, the **stronger the acid**

## Polyprotic Acids
> An acid with more than one proton. Or more than one **hydrogen that can disassociate**. 
> - Each hydrogen has its own $K_{a}$ value
> - The $K_{a}$ values generally decrease with each proton
