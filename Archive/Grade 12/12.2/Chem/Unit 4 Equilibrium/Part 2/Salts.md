#Equilibrium 
# Salts
---
> When a salt disassociates, it can create ions that are [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acids or Bases]]. Or they can create a **common ion effect**.
> However, these are likely [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Stupid Weak]]

## Ions Of Strong Acids and Bases
> The ions of strong acids or bases do not react with water and are neutral (like $\ce{Cl-}$, $\ce{Na+}$, $\ce{K+}$, etc...)

> This is in the definition of a strong acid or base, Its [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate]] will not try and reform the acid (act as a base)

## Ions Of Weak Acids and Bases
> The ions of [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acids]] form [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] causing the [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acids or Bases]] to significantly effect the [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]].

> Think of $\ce{NaF}$ in water, it will fully disassociate and the $\ce{F-}$ will act as a base and react with water to form $HF$.
## Combination Of Acidic and Basic Ions
> When they are combined, look at the constants and see which one is stronger.
