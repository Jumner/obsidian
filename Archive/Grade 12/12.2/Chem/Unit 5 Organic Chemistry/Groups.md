# Groups

> There are endless amounts of groups.

## Carbonyl
> A carbonyl group is a carbon with a double bonded oxygen.
> ![[Pasted image 20220601092420.png]]
> This makes the **Ketones** which end in **One** like Propan**one** 
> There are many groups derived by it

### Aldehydes And Ketones
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a hydrogen creates an **Aldehyde**
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with 2 [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chains]] creates a **Ketone** 
> ![[Pasted image 20220601092809.png]]
> **Al**dehydes end in **Al**. For example Methan**al** or formaldehyde.
> Ket**one**s end in **One**. For example Propan**one** (acetone).
> 
> Another way to think of this is if the double bond is **at the end** of the chain its an **Aldehyde**, if its in **the middle**, its a **Ketone**

### Ester
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a single bonded oxygen creates an **Ester**
> These create fruity scent
> ![[Pasted image 20220601093441.png]]
> MethylEthan**oate** is an Ester group with R being ethyl and R' being a [[#Methyl]]
> These form from [[#Carboxyl|Carboxylic Acids]] and [[#Hydroxyl|Alcohols]]. They end in **Oate**
> ![[Pasted image 20220603084254.png]]
> Ethylethanoate (An ethyl group (left) bonded to a ethanoate group (right))
> In biology, **ester bonds** are formed between a [[#Hydroxyl]] and a [[#Carboxyl]] via [[Reactions#Condensation|Dehydration Synthesis]]
#### Ether
> The ether group is simply a oxygen between 2 sidechains.
> ![[Pasted image 20220603083803.png]]
> These have **oxy** in the name **Methoxy**ethane (A methoxy group on an ethane)
> The Because Methoxy (A [[#Methyl]] connected with an oxygen) is a group, 2-Methoxypropane is a propane with methyl ether connected to the middle of the propane (carbon 2).
> ![[Pasted image 20220609091155.png]]
> These are also named **Methyl Ethyl Ether**
### Carboxyl
> A carboxyl group is a [[#Carbonyl]] group with a [[#Hydroxyl]] group. This creates the **Carboxyl group**
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085205.png]]
> The hydrogen on the hydroxide disassociates and makes it acidic.
> When it is bound to another structure, it becomes an acid and ends in **oic acid**. Eg Acidic acid is actually ethan**oic** acid ([[#Carboxyl]] and a [[#Methyl]]).
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] you get [[Benzene#Benzoic Acid|Benzoic Acid]] 

### Acetyl
> An acetyl group is a [[#Carbonyl]] group with a [[#Methyl]] group. 
> ![[Pasted image 20220602194520.png]]
> This also creates the [[#Acetyl]] [[#Ether]], oxyacetyl (acetate) which has an oxygen before the sidechain
### Amide
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a [[#amino]] group
> $R'$ and $R''$ are **almost** always hydrogen
> ![[Pasted image 20220601093419.png]]
>  These are called **amides** (**Methanamide**)
>  An example of a tertiary [[#Amide]] is N,N-dimethylbutan-1-amide (R is Butanyl, R',R'' is [[#Methyl]]).
## Amino
> The amino group is a nitrogen and 2 hydrogens.
> Slightly basic and smell like garbage.
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085304.png]]
> These are called **Amines** (**Methan-1-amine**)
> Like [[#Hydroxyl|Alcohols]], there are primary, secondary, and tertiary Amines (Depending on how many sidechains).
> The main chain is at the end and ends in amine.
> Side chains are marked as N-
> For example, N-Methyl-N-BromoHexamine is an [[#Amino]] with a hexyl, methyl, and bromo group.
> Or can be named N-Methyl-N-BromoAminoHexane
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] it becomes [[Benzene#Analine|Analine]]
## Methyl
> The methyl group is a carbon and 3 hydrogens
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085709.png]]
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] its called [[Benzene#Toluene|Toluene]]

## Hydroxyl
> The hydroxyl group is a **hydroxide**
> ![[Pasted image 20220601090516.png]]
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] its called [[Benzene#Phenol|Phenol]]
### Alcohols
> These create the **Alcohols** and end in **ol**. Eg methan**ol** you actually put the number in between **methan-1-ol** becomes methanol. Because there is **one carbon** bound the the **alcohols carbon**, it's called a **primary alcohol**

### Polarity
> The [[#Hydroxyl]] groups is super [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar]] and it makes alcohols **polar**.
> This **[[Polarity#Polarity|Polarity]] decreases** as the **size increases**.

## Phenyl
> Though [[Benzene#Phenol|Phenol]] is a compound on its own. When [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] is a [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chain]] it is called Phenyl.
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085636.png]]  

## Benzyl
> Counter Intuitively, the [[#Benzyl]] group is a [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] and a methyl group. Essentially a [[Benzene#Toluene|Toluene]] group.
