# Alkanes
---
> Alkanes are unmodified **Single bonded** [[Hydrocarbons#Aliphatic|Aliphatic Hydrocarbon]] chains. These end in **ane** and follow [[Hydrocarbons#Prefix|The Pattern]].
> These are called **saturated**
> $\ce{C_{x}H_{2n+2}}$ 
# Alkenes
---
> Alkenes are [[Hydrocarbons#Aliphatic|Aliphatic Hydrocarbon]] chains that contain **One or more double bonds**.
> These end in **Ene** and follow [[Hydrocarbons#Prefix|The Pattern]].
> These are called **Unsaturated**
> $\ce{C_{x}H_{2x+2-2y}}$ 

## Reactivity
> The **double bond** makes it **more reactive**. For example Ethane will react with chlorine to make 1,2-dichloroethane.
> [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] **does not** have this effect
# Alkynes
---
> Alkenes are [[Hydrocarbons#Aliphatic|Aliphatic Hydrocarbon]] chains that contain **One or more triple bonds**.
> These end in **Yne** and follow [[Hydrocarbons#Prefix|The Pattern]].
> These are [[#Alkenes|Also]] called **Unsaturated**
> $\ce{C_{x}H_{2x+2-4y}}$
