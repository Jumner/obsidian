# Hydrocarbons
---
> Hydrocarbons are molecules made only of **hydrogen** and **carbon**
> Oil is a form of super long chain hydrocarbons.

## Aliphatic
> [[#Hydrocarbons]] that only have [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes]], and [[Cyclic]] structures
## Aromatic
> [[#Hydrocarbons]] Based on **[[Benzene]]** or other similar structures.
> Because they are [[Bonding Theories#Resonance|Resonant Structures]], carbon one is wherever the most important [[Groups#Groups|Group]] is. The position can be ignored if there is only one [[Groups#Groups|Group]]. 
> ![[Benzene#Benzene]]
> 

## Prefix
> The prefix of a carbon chain follows **[[IUPAC#IUPAC|IUPAC Nomenclature]]**:
> 1. **Eth**
> 2. **Meth**
> 3. **Prop**
> 4. **But**
> 5. **Pent**
> 6. **Hex**
> 7. **Hept**
> 8. **Oct**
> 9. **Non**
> 10. **Dec**

## Isomers
> [[#Isomers]] are molecules that have the **same formula** but **different structure**
> They are super common in [[#Organic Chemistry]] because [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon chains]] can be organized in many ways

> Find the longest chain (**even if it curves**) and start counting from the **first branch**. Then name using [[IUPAC#IUPAC|IUPAC]...
>
> **(Carbon number)-(Branch Name)(Longest Chain Name)**
> Many chains use commas like 2,2-DimethylButane
>![[Pasted image 20220530091136.png]] Also make sure to pick the one with the **Largest number of branches** This is because nested branches suck.


### Branch Groups
> ![[Pasted image 20220530092548.png]]
> There are lots of different groups
> 1-Chloro-2-NitroEthane is $\ce{ClCH2 CHNO2}$ 

## Naming [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkenes|Alkenes]] and [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkynes|Alkynes]]
> These are named in a similar way except the bond location is specified
> Instead of 2,2DiMethylHeptane, you get 2,2DiMethyl-Hept-4-ene ($\ce{CH3 C(CH3)2 CH2 CH CH2}$)
> The number is the **start** of the double/triple bond.

### Di-Enes
> If you have more than one double bond, you have another different ending
> Instead of Pentane, you get Penta-1,4-DiEne or Penta-1,2,3,4-TetraEne
> 
> Combining Enes and Ynes you can get Deca-1,2-DiEne-5-Yne

### Cis Vs Trans Isomers
> Since a double bond doesn't allow rotation like single bonds, there are even more isomer possiblities
> ![[Pasted image 20220530094518.png]]
> Cis (Same) have groups on the same side
> Trans (different) mave groups on opposite sides
> **Cis or Trans goes before the number**
> But-Cis-2-Ene or Cis-2-Butene
