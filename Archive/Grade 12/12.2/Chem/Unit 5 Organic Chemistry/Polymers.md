# Monomers
> Monomers are a compound that can be chained.
> It must be able to **bond to 2 of itself**
# Polymers
> Polymers are what happens when you chain [[#Monomers]] 
> - **plastics**
> - **Nucleic Acids**
> - Starch, Cellulose
> These usually have 2 [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] groups which join together as an [[Groups#Ether|Ether]] via [[Reactions#Condensation|Dehydration Synthesis]] 

## Addition Polymers
> [[#Addition Polymers]] react to form a long [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] via **Addition**
> The [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chain]] are kept and **repeated**.

## Condensation Polymers
> When a [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxide]] group reacts with a hydrogen to form [[Groups#Ester|Esters]], [[Groups#Ether|Ethers]], or [[Groups#Amide|Amide]], etc... via [[Reactions#Condensation|Condensation Synthesis]]
> 
> [[Reactions#Groups Hydroxyl Alcohol And Groups Carboxyl Carboxylic Acid|Carboxylic Acid and Alcohol]] -> [[Groups#Ester|Esters]]
> [[Reactions#Groups Amino Amine And Groups Carboxyl Carboxylic Acid|Carboxylic Acid and Amine]] -> [[Groups#Amide|Amides]]
> 2 [[Groups#Alcohols|diols]] -> [[Groups#Ether|Ether]]

## Natural Polymers
> Glucose chains to form cellulose

> Proteins chain from **amino acid** [[#Monomers]] with different [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chains]]

## Poly Ethylene Terephthalate
> PET is the plastic that makes up most plastic bottles

## Poly Lactic Acid
> The most common 3d printing plastic.
> It is a chain of lactic acid (2-Hydroxypropanoic acid)
> It is also "biodegradable"
