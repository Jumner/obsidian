## Polar Covalent Bond
A Polar Covalent bond occurs when the difference in **Electronegativity** is greater than 0.5 and less than 1.7. The [[Electrons]] will be pulled towards the atom with the **higher** electronegativity, making it negative, and forming [[#Dipoles]].
### Dipoles
[[#Dipoles]] are formed with [[#Polar Covalent Bond|Polar Covalent Bonds]] (minor [[#Dipoles]] are formed in [[#Bond Type Table|Non-Polar Covalent Bonds]]). The element with higher **Electronegativity** will pull the [[Electrons]] closer making it **Partially** negative. This creates 2 [[#Dipoles]] $\delta^{+}$ and $\delta^{-}$ 
#### Dipole Moment
> The arrow that shows how the [[Electrons]] move. The sum of the [[#Dipole Moment|Dipole Moments]] gives the total **Molecule Dipole** or [[#Polyatomic Molecules|Polarity]].
## Molecular Polarity
### Diatomic Molecules
[[#Molecular Polarity]] is fairly simple because there is only one bond. The [[#Polarity]] of the **molecule** is the same as the [[#Polarity]] of the bond.
#### Example
$\ce{F_{2}-> F-F}$
$\ce{HCl -> H\delta+-Cl\delta-}$ 
### Polyatomic Molecules
[[#Molecular Polarity]] is determined using the $\Delta \text{EN}$ and the [[Vsepr#Molecular Geometry|VSEPR Shape]]. It is found using the sum of the [[#Dipole Moment|Dipole Moments]] for each bond in the molecule.
#### Example
$\ce{BF3 -> B\delta+F3\delta-}$ 
Because it is [[Vsepr#Trigonal Planar|Trigonal Planar]], the charges cancel out.
$\ce{CH2F2->C\delta+H2F2\delta-}$ 
Because it is [[Vsepr#Tetrahedral|Tetrahedral]], the charges from the 2 polar bonds will not fully cancel out and form a polar molecule.
