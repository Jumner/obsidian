# Half Reaction Method
---
A method of balancing [[Redox]] reactions using the [[Reduction Table]].
1. Find the two **half reactions**
2. Modify the **half reactions** by **reversing one of them** and multiplying by the coefficient to equalize the [[Electrons]]
3. Cancel out terms
4. Reduce coefficients
5. Check charges
6. Determine if reaction is **spontaneous** or not.
## Example
$\ce{MnO4- + H2S + H+ -> S + Mn^{2+} + H2O}$
Ox: $\ce{H2S -> S + 2H+ + 2e-}\times 5$  -0.14v
Red: $\ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- -> Mn^{2+} + 4H2O}\times 2$ 1.51v
$\ce{2MnO4- + 16H+ 5H2S -> 5S + 10H+ + 2Mn^{2+} + 8H2O}$
$\ce{2MnO4- + 5H2S + 6H+ -> 5S + 2Mn^{2+} + 8H2O}$
$E\degree_{cell} = -0.14 + 1.51 = 1.37V$ **Reaction is spontaneous**!
