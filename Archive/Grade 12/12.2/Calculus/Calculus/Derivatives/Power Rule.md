# Power Rule
---
> The **Power Rule** is a rule that determines the [[Derivative#Definition Of the Derivative|Derivative]] of an exponent
> $$\begin{align}
f(x)&=x^{n}\\
f'(x)&=nx^{n-1}
\end{align}$$
> You can think of the exponent jumping down leaving one less behind
## Example
> $\frac{df}{dx}x^{2}=2x$
