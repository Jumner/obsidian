## Turning Point
> The turning point is the point when the slope [[Derivative#Definition Of the Derivative|(Derivative)]] goes from positive to negative. In other words when it hits zero

## Point of Inflection
> When the graph changes its concavity.
> These are found with the roots of the **second derivative**.

## Picking Intervals
> After you find where the derivative is zero. Split the domain into regions. Find the sign in the middle of each of these regions. These signs will usually alternate but wont if it touches zero. For example a parabola with 2 roots will have 3 regions.

## Local Min/Max
> The local min or max are points where the [[Derivative#Definition Of the Derivative|Derivative]] is zero **and the sign changes**. Can be found with [[Gradient Descent]]
