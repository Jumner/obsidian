## Critical Point
> A point where something happens. These include the following:

### Critical Number
> The x value of a [[#Critical Point]]. Unlike [[#Critical Point|Critical Points]], asymptotes do count here but they aren't useful. 

### Point of Inflection
> The point where the **concavity changes**. These are related to the **roots of the [[Higher Order Derivatives#Higher Order Derivatives|2nd Derivative]]**
> These occur when $f'(x)$ is 0 or undefined and the sign doesn't change.
> **Or** **Any time** $f''(x)$ **changes it sign**

### Extremes
> [[#Local Minimum|Mins]] and [[#Local Maximum|Maxs]] are **often** found when $f'(x)=0$ or $f'(x)$ is **Undefined**. The [[#Critical Point]] is then **$(x, f(x))$**.
> These **Always** occur **any time** $f'(x)$ **changes its sign**

#### Local Minimum
> A local minimum is a point where the function is low and higher on either side of the point. This may not be the [[#Global Minimum]].
##### Global Minimum
> The **absolute minimum** is the **lowest point in the entire function**. It might not exist. **There is only one value but can be multiple points of the same value**

> This needs to be a point. So **asymptotes don't apply** 

#### Local Maximum
> A local Maximum is a point where the function is high and lower on either side of the point. This may not be the [[#Global Maximum]].
##### Global Maximum
> The **absolute maximum** is the **highest point in the entire function**. It might be an asymptote or not exist. **There is only one value but can be multiple points of the same value**

> This needs to be a point. So **asymptotes don't apply**
