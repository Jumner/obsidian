# Asymptotes
---
## Vertical
> They are found **only** in rational or logarithmic functions
> [[#Vertical|Vertical Asymptotes]] are harder to find than [[#Horizontal|Horizontal Asymptotes]] 
> You evaluate the [[Limits#Left Hand Limit|Left and Right Hand Limit]] to see what happens near the asymptote
## Horizontal
> They are found in exponential or rational functions
> [[#Horizontal|Horizontal Asymptotes]] can be found using [[Limits to Infinity#Limits to Infinity|Limits to Infinity]]. You have to find the limit at **both $+\infty$ and $-\infty$**
> To find if it comes from above or below, evaluate the limit of $\lim_{x\to{\pm\infty}}f(x-a)$ where $a=$ HA
## Oblique
> Function approaches a diagonal line
> **Only in rational functions**
> The equation of the line is the quotient of [[Division#Long Division|Division]].To find where it approaches from, take the limit of the remainder.

## Finding Asymptote
> if $f(x)= \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$
> if deg $p(x)<$ deg $q(x)$, HA: $y=0$
> if deg $p(x)=$ deg $q(x)$, HA: $\frac{\text{Largest Coefficient of }p(x)}{\text{Largest Coefficient of }q(x)}$
> if deg $p(x) >$ deg $q(x)$ by one, HA: $y=mx+b$ ([[#Oblique]])
