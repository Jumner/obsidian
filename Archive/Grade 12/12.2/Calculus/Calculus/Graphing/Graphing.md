# Function Analysis
---
> A list of priories to analyze.

> 1. **Domain:** What is the **Domain** and **Range**? Are there any [[Graphing Split Functions#Removable Discontinuity|RDs]], or **domain**/**range** restrictions of any kind?
> 	1. $\log_{b{g(x)},}g(x)>0$
> 	2. $\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}, q(x)\ne0$
> 	3. $\sqrt[n]{g(x)},g(x)\ge0 \lor n\bmod2=1$    
> 2. **Intercepts:** Where are the **x** and **y** intercepts?
> 3. **Asymptotes**: Where are the [[Asymptotes#Vertical|VAs]]? Is there a [[Asymptotes#Oblique|OA]] or [[Asymptotes#Horizontal|HA(s)]].
> 4. **1st Derivative:** Where is the [[Derivative#Definition Of the Derivative|1st Derivative]] positive, negative, or zero? ([[Archive/Grade 12/12.2/Calculus/Calculus/Graphing/Definitions#Critical Point|Critical Points]])
> 	1. Solve $f'(x)=0$ **AND** $f'(x)= \text{Undefined}$ 
> 5. **2nd Derivative:** Where is the [[Higher Order Derivatives#Higher Order Derivatives|2nd Derivative]] positive, negative, or zero?
> 	1. Solve $f''(x)=0$ **AND** $f''(x)=\text{Undefined}$
