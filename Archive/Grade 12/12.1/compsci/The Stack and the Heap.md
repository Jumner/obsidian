# The Stack and the Heap
these are both areas of **memory** with their own positives and negatives

# Stack
- Super quick
- can only be accessed sequentially
- where the **Stack Frame** lives

# Heap
- Requires overhead
- Useful for data structures with changing or unknown size at compile time
- pointer to item in **[[The Stack and the Heap#Heap|Heap]]** can be stored in the **[[The Stack and the Heap#Stack|Stack]]** to be used by the program.
