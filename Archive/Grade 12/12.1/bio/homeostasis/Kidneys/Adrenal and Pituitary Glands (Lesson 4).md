# Adrenal Gland
---
Consists of [[#Cortex]] and [[#Medulla]]

## Cortex
- For day to day activities
- Produces 2 types of **corticosteroid** hormones
	- **Glucocorticoid**
		- Controlled by the [[#Pituitary Gland]] and **Hypothalamus**
		- **Hypothalamus** releases **corticotrophin**-releasing hormone which causes the [[#Pituitary Gland]] to release adrenal **cortitrophic** hormone **->** adrenal gland produces **corticosteroid** hormone
			- **Hydrocortisone** (**Cortisol**) Regulates **fat**, **protein**, and **carbohydrates**. Increases **[[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#Blood Sugar|blood sugar]]**, immune system, and decreases inflammation and connective tissue growth ^a4d726
			- **Corticosterone** Regulates immune response with [[#^a4d726|Hydrocortisone]]
	- **Mineralcorticoids**
		- Controlled by the [[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#The Kidneys|Kidneys]]
		- Mainly just [[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Aldosterone|Aldosterone]]
	- Some **sex hormones** but overshadowed
## Medulla
- For **emergency** response
- But also works with **stress**
- **[[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Epinephrine|Epinephrine]]**
- **[[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Norepinephrine|Norepinephrine]]**


# Pituitary Gland
---
- Made of **[[#Anterior lobe]]** and **[[#Posterior lobe]]**
## Anterior lobe
- Releases **Growth hormone**
- Releases **[[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#^c2ad9c|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)]]**
- Releases **Adrenocorticotropic** hormone
## Posterior lobe
- Releases **Vasopressin** -> Water conservation
- Releases **Oxytocin** -> **Positive** feedback loop during **childbirth**
