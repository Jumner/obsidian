# The Neuron
---
## Parts of a Neuron
###### Axon
- Releases **neurotransmitters** into the **synapse**
- **Neurotransmitters** either:
	1. **Diffuse** into the brain
	2. Are destroyed by an **Enzyme**
	3. Are brought back into the [[#Axon]] by a **reuptake** **protein** 
		- Taking more of a **neurotransmitter** will result in more **reuptake proteins** and a less **potent** response (**Dependency**)
###### Dendrites
- Receive **neurotransmitters** from the **synapse**
- **Behavior** determined by the **neurotransmitter**
###### Receptor
- **[[What is homeostasis? (Lesson 1)#Monitors|Sensor]]** for various **stimuli**
###### Myelin Sheath
- **Protects** the [[#When triggered|never impulse]]

## There are **4** types of neurons
| Name           | [[#Dendrites]]                | [[#Axon\|Axons]] |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Unipolar       | 1                             | 1                |
| Bipolar        | [[#Receptor]]                 | 1                |
| Pseudounipolar | Many [[#Receptor\|Receptors]] | 1                |
| Multipolar     | 1                             | 1                |

The resting charge in nerves is **-70mv**
This is due to the sodium potassium **pumps** which removes **sodium** and adds **potassium**

## When triggered
- **Sodium** is let in -> **+40mv** 
- **Potassium** is let out -> **-90mv**
- Works as a wave through the neuron
- Needs **~3ms** to recover (**Refractory period**)

## At the end
- **Calcium** is let in and it attracts to **vesicles**
- These **vesicles** are a bubble of **neurotransmitter**
- They reach the end of the **axon** and are let out into the **synapse**

### Presynaptic neuron
- The neuron that transmits to a synapse

### Postsynaptic neuron
- The neuron that transceives from a synapse
