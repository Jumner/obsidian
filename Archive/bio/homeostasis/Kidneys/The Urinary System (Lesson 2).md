# The Urinary System

<br/>
---
> ## The Kidneys
> **Kidneys** are small organs in your back that are about the size of your fist
> - They filter a bathtub of blood per day
> - They initially lose about **120ml** of fluid per minute but reclaim **119ml** of that lost liquid
> - Results in around 1ml of pee per minute
> - A bunch of **medulla** that are surrounded by a **cortex**

---

## Bladder
- At **200ml**, your bladder stretches and you feel the need to go
- At **400ml**, ml you really have to go
- At **600ml**, your body has enough and your body forces you to go
- peeing is controlled by the **internal** and **external** sphincters

> ## Nephron
> - Millions in the [[#The Kidneys|kidneys]]
> - **Blood pressure** forces water and particulates through the **capillaries** into the **proximal convoluted tubule**
> - Filtering process is called **ultrafiltration**
> - Goes through the **cortex** and **medulla**

### Parts of the [[#Nephron]]

## Glomerulus
- A network of **capillaries**
- **Small holes** which let small molecules and **water** through
- Surrounded by the [[#The Bowman's capsule]]

## The Bowman's capsule
- Surrounds the [[#Glomerulus]]

## Afferent and Efferent Arterioles
- **Afferent** Arteriole is before the [[#Glomerulus]]
- **Efferent** Arteriole is after the [[#Glomerulus]]

## Proximal Convoluted Tubule
- Before the [[#Loop of Henle]]
- Has more mitochondria than the heart
- Removes the **vast majority** of water and is **not configurable**
- Uses **active transport** to pump out sodium into the **interstitial fluid**. Water will then follow the sodium and eventually enter the bloodstream
- **Potassium** is pumped **in** to replace the sodium
- **Bicarbonates** leave because of the **hydrogen** ions in your blood
- **Glucose** is also pumped out to safe energy

## Distal Convoluted Tubule
- Water re-absorption  is **configurable**
- **Calcium** is re-absorbed in the presence of **ADH** 
- **Sodium** (and **water**) is re-absorbed in the presence of **[[#Aldosterone]]** which is released by the **[[Adrenal and Pituitary Glands (Lesson 4)#Adrenal Gland|Adrenal Gland]]** and controlled by the **[[Adrenal and Pituitary Glands (Lesson 4)#Pituitary Gland|Pituitary Gland]]**


# Loop of Henle
---
## Descending Loop
- Water flows out into the **interstitial fluid** because of the salt content
## Ascending Loop
- Actively pumps sodium out into the **interstitial fluid** So it can be re-absorbed into the blood

# Chemicals
---
## Aldosterone
- Causes water to be **re-absorbed** in the [[#Distal Convoluted Tubule]]
- This water increases **[[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#Blood Pressure|blood pressure]]**

## Angiotensin
- Causes the **blood vessels** to **narrow** -> Increasing **blood pressure**
- Causes the **adrenal gland** to release [[#Aldosterone]]
## Epinephrine
- Causes a spike in **heart rate** and a fight or flight response
- Raises [[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#Blood Pressure|blood pressure]]
- Causes a release of **glucagon** which spikes the [[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#Blood Sugar|blood sugar]]
## Norepinephrine
- Counter acts the effects of **[[#Epinephrine]]**
- Also causes **[[#Angiotensin]]** to spike, increasing **[[Blood Pressure (Lesson 3)#Blood Pressure|blood pressure]]**
