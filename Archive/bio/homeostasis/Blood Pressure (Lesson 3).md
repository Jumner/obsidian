# Blood Pressure
---
<br/>

## Juxtaglomerular cells
- Acts as a [[What is homeostasis? (Lesson 1)#Monitors|Monitor]] for blood pressure
- Sits between the [[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Glomerulus|glomerulus]] and the [[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#The Bowman's capsule|bowman's capsule]]
- **Low** blood pressure will cause the kidney to release **renin** -> **angiotensinogen** -> **[[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Angiotensin|angiotensin]]**


# Blood Sugar
---
<br/>

Controlled by the **Hypothalamus**
- Increases after eating then slowly drops

## Too high
- **Insulin** is released by **beta cells** in the **pancreas** and **glucose** is stored in the **muscles** and **liver**  
## Too low
- **Glucagon** is released by the **alpha cells** in the **pancreas** and **glucose** is released by the **liver**

# Diabetes
---
## Type 1
- **Insulin** is not produced by the **pancreas**
## Type 2
- Unable to use **insulin**

# Thyroid
---
- **Hypothalamus** releases **T**hyroid **R**eleasing **H**ormone (**TRH**)
- Anterior **pituitary gland** releases **T**hyroid **S**timulating **H**ormone (**TSH**) which controls the **thyroid** ^c2ad9c
- **Thyroid** will then either release **Calcitonin** or **T4**
- **T4** inhibits **TRH**

## **Hypo**thyroidism (Low T4)
- Cold intolerance
- Weight gain
- Dry skin
- Moody
- Tired
- Goiter
- Possible **low iodine**

## **Hyper**thyroidism (High T4)
- Heat intolerance
- Weight "loss"
- Sweating
- Protruding eyes
- Possible **high iodine**

# Parathyroid
- **4** small glands in the [[#Thyroid|thyroid gland]]
- Maintains **calcium** in the bones
- Set by the **Hypothalamus**

## Too high
- Releases **Calcitonin** -> Bones uptake **calcium**
## Too low
- Releases **parathyroid hormone** (**PTH**) -> Bones release **calcium**
- **PTH** causes the [[The Urinary System (Lesson 2)#Distal Convoluted Tubule|DCT]] to re-absorb **calcium**
