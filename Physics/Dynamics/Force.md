# Force
---
Something that **accelerates** an object
### $\vec{F_{net}}$
> The **Net** force on an object
> Used to find **acceleration** $$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F_{net}}}{m}$$
### Mass
> The amount of matter in something.
> Measured in kilograms
### Weight
> The force of **gravity** on a [[#Mass]] 
> $$\vec{g}=9.80N/Kg[\downarrow]$$
### $\vec{F_{g}}$
> The force of gravity
> $$\vec{F_{g}}= m\cdot\vec{g}$$
### $\vec{F_{N}}$ 
> The **Normal Force** is the force of the **ground pushing up** on you.
> It is usually but not always equal and opposite to [[Force#vec F_ g|Force of Gravity]]
