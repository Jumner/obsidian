## Newtons 3 Laws
### Newtons 1st Law
**Inertia**: Objects in Motion will remain in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced **force**
> When forces are balanced, there's no **acceleration**
### Newtons 2nd Law
**$F_{net}=ma$** 
> When forces are unbalanced, the acceleration is equal to $\frac{\vec{F_{net}}}{\vec{a}}$ 
### Newtons 3rd Law
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
> When you push on something, that thing will push back.
