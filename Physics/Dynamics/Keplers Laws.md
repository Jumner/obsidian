## Law of Ellipses
> Every orbit is not a circle but an **ellipse** the orbited body sits at one of 2 **focal points**

> How elliptical an object is
## Law of Equal Areas
> The area swept out by an orbiting planet over a **period of time**

## Law of Harmonies
> $C= \frac{R^{3}}{T^{2}}$ , $C_{Sun}= \frac{R_{\text{orbital r of earth}}}{T_{orbit}} m^{3}/s^{2}$ 
> C is a constant and you can use it to find the orbital period of a different body
