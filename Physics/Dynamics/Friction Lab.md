### You will determine the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between a ramp and some small object (such as a coin).
1. Place the coin on the ramp and experiment to find the maximum possible angle (to the nearest degree) of inclination just before the coins begin to slide.
The maximum angle before sliding = $16\degree$ 

2. Draw the FBD for the coin on the ramp just before it begins to slide. Use this to find the coefficient of static friction.

$$\mu_s=0.287$$

3. Choose a slightly larger inclination angle and time how long it takes the coin to slide down the ramp .Do this three times. Measure the length of the ramp.  Calculate the acceleration down the ramp and determine the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Angle = $26\degree$
Length of ramp (Length of travel) = $74.5\text{cm} = 0.745m$
Time to slide = $\text{avg(0.995, 1.120, 1.095)} = 1.07s$

$\vec{a} = 1.3 \text{m/s}^{2}[\text{DTR}]$
$\mu_{k}=0.340$
