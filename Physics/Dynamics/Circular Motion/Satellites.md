## Homework
1. Calculate the gravitational force of attraction between two objects of masses 900 g and 400 g placed with their centres 30 cm apart.
$$\begin{align}
&\vec{F_{g}}= \frac{G\cdot0.4\cdot0.9}{0.3^{2}}= 2.7\cdot10^{-11}
\end{align}$$
2. Calculate the gravitational attraction between a proton of mass 1.67 x10-27 kg and an electron of mass 9.11 x10-31 kg if they are 5 x10-11 m apart.
$$\begin{align}
&\vec{F_{g}}= \frac{G\cdot1.67\cdot9.11\cdot10^{-58}}{(5\cdot10^{-11})^{2}}=4\cdot10^{-47}N
\end{align}$$
3. At a certain point between the Earth and the Moon the total gravitational force exerted on an object by the Earth and the Moon is zero. If the Earth-Moon distance is 3.84 x105 km and the moon has 1.2% of the Earths mass where is this point located?
$$\begin{align}
& \frac{1}{x^{2}}= \frac{0.012}{(3.84\cdot10^{5}-x)^{2}}\\
& 0= \frac{0.012x^{2}}{(3.84\cdot10^{5}-x)^{2}}-1\\
&x=346088km
\end{align}$$
4. The planet Saturn has a mass of 5.67 x1026 kg and a radius of 6.3 x107 m. Calculate the acceleration due to gravity on Saturn. How much will the force of gravity on a 60 kg man be on Saturn?
$$\begin{align}
&\vec{F_{g}}= \frac{Gm5.67\cdot10^{26}}{(6.3\cdot10^{7})^{2}}\\
&\cancel{m}a=\frac{G\cancel{m}5.67\cdot10^{26}}{(6.3\cdot10^{7})^{2}}=9.53\\
&m=60, \vec{F_{g}}=572N
\end{align}$$
