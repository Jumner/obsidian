#Momentum 
# Frames of Reference 
---
## Inertial Frame
> Follows the [[Dynamics#Newtons 1st Law|Law of Inertia]]
> Moving at a **constant** Velocity
> When making a new frame of reference, always notate with "\*new Frame of Reference +#"
## Non-Inertial Frame
> Breaks the [[Dynamics#Newtons 1st Law|Law of Inertia]]
> [[#Fictitious Force]] are created
### Accelerated Frame
> When the [[#Frames of Reference|Frame of Reference]] is accelerating, things will appear to accelerate without any force acting on it. 
### Rotational Frame
> Has an imaginary [[#Fictitious Force]] appears to push outwards and is called **centrifugal Force**

### Fictitious Force
> An imaginary force used to explain weird behaviour in a [[#Non-Inertial Frame|Non-Inertial Frame of Reference]]
