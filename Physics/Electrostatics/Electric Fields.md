## Intensity
> The intensity of an [[#Electric Fields|Electric Field]] is determined by the force of that field over the charge. Or the force per unit charge

> $$\begin{align}
\epsilon&=\frac{F}{\text{Unit Charge}}\\
\epsilon&=\frac{F}{q_{2}}\\
&=\frac{kq_{1}\cancel{q_{2}}}{r^{2}\cancel{q_{2}}}\\
&=\frac{kq}{r^{2}}\text{N/C}
\end{align}$$
> You divide by q2 because q2 is **observing** the [[#Intensity]] of the first object.
> $\epsilon>0=$ Repel
> $\epsilon<0=$ Attract
> $\vec{F_{e}}=\vec{\epsilon}q$ Just like $\vec{F_{g}}=m/\vec{a}$ the force is the **charge** times the [[#Intensity]]
## Field Lines
> The lines that show the direction of [[#Electric Fields]]
> Shows where forces would act on a charge
