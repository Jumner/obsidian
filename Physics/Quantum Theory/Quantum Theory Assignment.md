# The Photoelectric effect
> In 1887, it was discovered that photons can cause some metals to shoot off their electrons which are then called **Photoelectrons**. Each photoelectron is created by **just one photon**. However, this effect only happens above a certain frequency. After this threshold, the kinetic energy of the photoelectron scales linearly with frequency. 
> In order to find the energy a backwards voltage is applied in order to repel the photoelectrons. At some point, the electrons can no longer reach the output plate and no current flows. This finds the energy of the photoelectron. This finds the kinetic energy of the initial photon. Since the photons total energy is given by Plancks $E=hf$, you can find the energy from frequency $E_{k}=hf-W$ (seen as $y=mx+b$) this makes $h$ the slope common to all materials. This was then confirmed by empirical evidence.

## Photodiodes And Cameras
> Photodiodes are pieces of pn semiconductor which relies on the **photoelectric effect** to produce a **current** across the diode. There is then another semiconductor chip which converts the analog current value to frequency (colour) using the **work function of the diode**, and **Plancks constant**. It then converts the frequency to the **red green blue** values which are then stored in the camera.
