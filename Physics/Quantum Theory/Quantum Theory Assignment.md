# Black Body Radiation
> Black body radiation is light that is emitted by object and the composition of the light depends on the temperature. This is the cause for hot metal glowing red, fire being orange/yellow/white/blue, and the ability for thermal cameras to operate.

## The Ultraviolet Catastrophy

> The ultraviolet catastrophe is the discovery that the intensity of black body radiation is not inversely proportional to wavelength as predicted by **Rayleigh Jeans Law**. Instead, it tapers off quickly once in the ultraviolet range.

### Plancks Quanta Hypothysis
> Max Planck proposed a solution. He proposed that energy is not a single continuous value but a **Quant**ity packets of energy. His theory fit the experimental data very accurately. 
> Though Planck himself was not pleased by the explanation, Einstein later used it to explain the **photoelectric effect**, creating what is now called modern physics.

# The Photoelectric effect
> In 1887, it was discovered that photons can cause some metals to shoot off their electrons which are then called **Photoelectrons**. Each photoelectron is created by **just one photon**. However, this effect only happens above a certain frequency. After this threshold, the kinetic energy of the photoelectron scales linearly with frequency. 
> In order to find the energy a backwards voltage is applied in order to repel the photoelectrons. At some point, the electrons can't reach the output plate and no current flows. This finds the energy of the photoelectron. This finds the kinetic energy of the initial photon. Since the photons total energy is given by plancks $E=hf$. So therefore, you can find work done by the photon $W=E_{k}-hf$
