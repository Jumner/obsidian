# Black Body Radiation
> Black body radiation is light that is emitted by object and the composition of the light depends on the temperature. This is the cause for hot metal glowing red, fire being orange/yellow/white/blue, and the ability for thermal cameras to operate.

## The Ultraviolet Catastrophy
![[Pasted image 20220530100823.png]]
> The ultraviolet catastrophe is the discovery that the intensity of black body radiation is not inversely proportional to wavelength as predicted by **Rayleigh Jeans Law**. Instead, it tapers off quickly once in the ultraviolet range.

### Plancks Quanta Hypothysis
> Max Planck proposed a solution. He proposed that energy is not a single continuous value but a **Quant**ity packets of energy. His theory fit the experimental data very accurately. 
> Though Planck himself was not pleased by the explanation, Einstein later used it to explain the **photoelectric effect**, creating what is now called modern physics.
