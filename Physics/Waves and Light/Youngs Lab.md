# Young's Experiment
---
**<u>Purpose:</u>**
To study the pattern of the light produced when it passes through double slits and determine the wavelengths read and blue light.
**<u>Apparatus:</u>**
- Double slit card
- Showcase
- Red and blue filters
- Meter stick
- Neon laser
**<u>Procedure and Observations:</u>**
1. View the write filament through the double slit from a distance of about 3.0m or more. Describe ***in detail*** the interference pattern you see:
2. View the light source when covered first with a red filter, then with a blue filter. Stand *<u>about</u>* 3.0m from the light. You must be able to see the bands. While one partner looks through the slits, the other partner spans the interference pattern with their fingers under the direction of the first partner. Complete the chart below.
**<u>Observations:</u>**

**<u>Questions:</u>**
