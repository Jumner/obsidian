# Refraction
---
> When light travels through a [[#Boundary]] its speed will change.
> The light gets **"dragged"** behind and it changes the angle of the [[#Direction of Propagation]]

## Refractive Index
> A number $n$ that shows how much slower light is in a medium
> $$\begin{align}
v=\frac{c}{n}
\end{align}$$
### Snell's Law
> $$\begin{align}
\frac{\sin{\theta_{1}}}{\sin{\theta_{2}}}&=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{2}}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\\
\end{align}$$
When you are using it, **pick 2 parts** that are **easy to calculate**. 

## Direction of Propagation
The **direction** of the "light rays".
## Angle Of Incidence
The angle of the line **relative** to the **normal**.
## Angle of Refraction
The angle of the line **after the refraction** relative to the **normal**.

## Boundary
> Also known as an **Interface**, this is the **Boundary** between 2 **mediums** of different **densities**. Light will travel slower in the denser medium
## Frequency
> Once light has left its source, the frequency is **Fixed** it **does not change**. This is because velocity and wavelength are **both changed**.
