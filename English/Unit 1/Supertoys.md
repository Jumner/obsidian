Short Story Questions

1. What is a novum? Find two from the text and use quotes as support.

>A novum is a invention that is science fiction but is realistic. The realistic nature allows the reader to relate to the setting.

> 1. "It seems like a paradox that in this day and age we can create life but not intelligence" (Pg 1). Nothing is perfect and seeing futuristic technology fall short of the expectations of the people of its time is quite realistic.

> 2. "Dear Mummy, I love you and Daddy and the sun is shining -" (Pg 4). Again showing the imperfections of the technology really makes it feel real. Text synthesis is a really hard problem, and the reader knows this. So showing that it has not magically perfected it adds to the immersion. Furthermore, this fragmented English is exactly what earlier text synthesis technology does (and current tech if you use it wrong). The text is over 50 years old, so Aldiss wouldn't have known but it's still interesting. 

2. What does it mean to be “real”? Is David real?
> robots are so close to being human that robots question if they're "real"
> David is not "real"

3. Why did Aldiss title the text “Supertoys Last all Summer Long”
> The Supertoys refer to the robots. In the case of the title, David. In the story, David is heavily personified, then later in the story, is disposed of just like an old toy. The title makes it seem like the toys last a long time which seems like good thing. This is ironic because the reader feels like David is abandoned instead of used.

5. What are the two settings of the text? Why are they significant?
> The two settings of the text are the "House" which has no windows and the board room that Henry presents in. They are significant because most people cannot imagine being that locked up. Having a story with just 2 settings is dystopian.
