# SVG Technical Report

## Abstract
SVG or **S**calable **V**ector **G**raphics are an image format that stores the information as instructions to create the image instead of the image itself. They require much less space and are able to be scaled up infinity without getting pixelated. The single downside is you can't use it for pictures.

## Rationale
This topic is very important for logos as you never know what resolution someone will view you logo with. Plus, it looks very unprofessional to have a pixelated logo. Therefore it is important that logos are able to be scaled up and down to any size. SVGs simply provide a new way of thinking about image formats. Why store the instructions to create an image of a specific size only for it to be resized later when you can store the information to create the image in the first place; at any size.

## Summary

### 1. What is it?
> Scalable Vector Graphics are a image format that is unlike any others. It is a **vector image format** which means it stores the instructions to create an image. It creates images out of lines and shapes rather than massive grids of pixels. Because of this, they take up much less space.

### 2. When was it discovered?
> The SVG image format was released in **1999** [^1]. This was after it was chosen out of a lineup of other vector formats. This is likely because of its refined usage of **XML** [^1].

### 3. Who invented it?
> The SVG image format was invented by a group of companies called the SVG Working Group [^2]. The group was created by W3C and was intended to replace an older format.

### 4. What are possible future applications
> Because of how well thought out the SVG image format was, it is still being used to this day. The concepts that SVG is based on have been used in other ways. An example of this is parametric modeling. 3d modelling is usually stored as a bunch of triangles. But instead, parametric modeling is stored as instructions to create the object. A combination of basic shapes. They can then be converted to a bunch of triangles for other applications. This is how 3d printing works. To come full circle, SVG's are used frequently for 3d modelling. Even I have inserted an SVG and extruded it up to make an emblem.

Other formats like PNG or JPEG store the colours at each pixel of the image
The SVG image format was not necessarily revolutionary. But it was the format that did it right and is still being used over 2 decades later.
