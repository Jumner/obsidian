# What is Homeostasis?
---
<br/>
## Homeostasis
- Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium in the body
- Where the body will regulate something back to a standard value

---

### **Homeostatic mechanisms have these three parts**

## Control Center
- A part of the body (normally the hypothalamus) which controls the standard value and is able to read the [[#Monitors]] and communicate with the [[#Effectors]] to control it.

## Monitors
- These are sensors or receptors which can sense the value
- They report the value to the [[#Control Center]] In order to control it

## Effectors
- The parts of the body that are able to control a value in the body
- They listen to the [[#Control Center]] to control the value back to its set range

---

# Thermoregulation
- The [[#Homeostasis|homeostatic]] regulation of temperature

>Your **blood** is what controls your temperature so most of the [[What is homeostasis? (Lesson 1)#Effectors|effectors]] rely and changing the position of the blood in your body
