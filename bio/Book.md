# Justin's book review (The Hacking of the American Mind)
---
First of all, this book changed my world view. I've never been that consumeristic, but never considered that the **pleasure** derived from consumerism comes at the direct cost of both **happiness** and **health**. **5 stars**.

I have a hard time reading long form content and I wasn't expecting the book to be so science based. In hindsight, I totally could have read it. Instead, I read the **audiobook**. The problem is that **I don't know the page numbers** of my quotes, Even worse, **I never took home my copy of the book**. So, I will give the chapter and a percentage through that chapter.

### Introduction

#### 0% (Opening Quote)

> 1. "Happiness is neither virtue nor pleasure nor this thing nor that. But simply growth. We are happy when we're growing".

This opening quote really hits home for me because I'm very passionate about learning, and I learn a ton of interesting and mostly useless stuff. But there is something so **joyful** of looking back a year and thinking of how much more I am than I used to be. How far I've come. And it's hopeful to look at myself now and think about where I'll be next year, and the year after that. Learning has always been a core part of me and I feel like it gives me **purpose**. I feel like this quote really reflects that for me.

#### 51%

> 2. Because pleasure and happiness for all their apparent similarities, are separate phoneme. And in their extreme, function as opposites. In fact, pleasure is the slippery slope to tolerance and addiction. While happiness is the key to long life. 

### Chapter 3

#### 85%

> 3. The problem is that EOPs and their drug counterparts, the opiates also downregulate the receptors though the law of mass action. And when opiate receptors downregulate, you go from wanting to needing.

This is the key to **addiction**. Overstimulation of the opiate receptors will lead to their downregulation. This makes normal life worse than the it was before. The result is that you further increase the stimulation of your opiate receptors. This is exactly the **vicious cycle of addiction**. Your life sucks, so you do drugs. The drugs feel good but now your life sucks more. So you do more drugs... And it doesn't even have to be anything physical. Anything that causes stimulation of the receptors can lead to addiction. Be that **gambling**, **Tiktok**, or **fentynl**.

### Chapter 7

#### 67%

> 4. We know this because we've been able to genetically remove that specific receptor from mice. When they don't have it, they are extremely anxious and no amount of antidepressants is gonna fix it. 

### Chapter 10

#### 7%

> 5. In contrast to dopamine, serotonin neurons have certain features that protect us from descending into the abyss. But they also prevent us from ascending towards nirvana. 

Before reading, I knew about dopamine and how its **downregulation leads to addiction**. But, I never thought about how if the same were true for serotonin, excess happiness would lead to depression. I also didn't know that downregulation is to protect the neurons from dying due to overstimulation. I think it's pretty clever how the serotonin 1a autoreceptors do a similar job but with a quicker response. The downside is that **depression is rampant**. I did some online research, and some serotonin effecting drugs can still cause downregulation. Namely MDMA. Some people were saying that if you took a break, then took a bunch of **tryptophan**, then **MDMA**, you will get a trip "like your first time". Just thought I would share.

### Chapter 12

#### 75%

> 6. "There is a very strong message from my country, the United States. Which is very rich, has gotten a lot richer over the last 50 years. But has gotten no happier".

It's very **easy** to think that consumerism will make you happier. But the truth is that it really won't. This data proves that. Though the book is about America, it still applies to Canada. The simple fact that **consumerism doesn't increase happiness**, just pleasure (and not really because of downregulation) says that our mindset is **deeply flawed**. This caught me off guard when I was reading because I never realized how much I've been unknowingly indoctrinated into this mindset. It makes me question what other terrible secrets our hiding in our society.

### Chapter 14

#### 20%

> 7. Marketing makes sure that fear remains front and center. Because fear means stress, and stress means cortisol, and prefrontal cortex be damned. It's time for the chocolate cake. 

### Chapter 16 

#### 2%

> 8. Reward is not contentment, and pleasure is not happiness. **—** Chronic excess reward interferes with contentment, **—** Business has conflated pleasure with happiness. Consciously and with clear cut intent.

This quote also lit a light bulb in my head. This quote is more of a summary and just puts it so simply. Pleasure is **not** happiness, and corporations **intentionally** confused the two to convince consumers that they **need** that new shiny toy. The big problem is that we're already wired to choose pleasure over contentment and so it works so perfectly to our detriment. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone knew that pleasure and happiness **are not the same**.

### Chapter 18

#### 57%

> 9. I learned that anxiety is excitement about the future. The problem is that the future never comes. And it's almost always worse in my head than it is in reality. 

### Chapter 20

#### 92% (Closing Qoute)

> 10. Those who abdicate happiness for pleasure, will end up with neither. The science says so.
