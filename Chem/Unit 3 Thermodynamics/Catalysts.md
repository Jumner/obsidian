#Thermodynamics 
# Catalysts
> Chemicals that are **not used in the reaction** but increases the reaction rate by **reducing the [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]]**.

[[#Catalysts]] Reduce the [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]] without changing the [[Thermochemistry#Change|Enthalpy]] $\Delta H$
The activation complex is then called the **Catalyzed Activation Complex**
## Heterogeneous [[#Catalysts]]
> [[#Catalysts]] with a **different** **State** than the **Reactants**
### Adsorption
> The **bonding of reactants** to the **surface of a solid catalyst**
> [[#Adsorption]] is often accompanied by **bond breaking**, **reducing the [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]] of the Reaction**

#### Example
**Catalytic Converters** (A grid of platinum group metals)
$\ce{FeO}$ 
$\ce{N2 + 3H2 ->[FeO] 2NH3}$ 
## Homogeneous [[#Catalysts]]
> [[#Catalysts]] with the **Same State** as the **Reactants**

### ChloroFlouroCarbons
Catalyze the breakdown of **Ozone**
## Biological [[#Catalysts]] ([[#Enzymes]])
## Why [[#Catalysts]] Work
They work by **breaking it into a couple steps**, each with a **lower** [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]].

[[#Adsorption]] Holds chemicals in place and allows them to react.
$\ce{2CO + O2 ->[Pt] 2CO2}$

They can also be an intermediary that bonds with the chemicals but cancel out in the end.
# Enzymes
> **Huge proteins** that **decrease** the [[Collision Geometry#Activation Energy|Activation Energy]] of a reaction (usually a metabolic one). It does this because it **Controls the Orientation**, **Stresses the bonds**, and **Can add Energy through ATP**.
