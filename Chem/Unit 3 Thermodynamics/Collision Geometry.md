#Thermodynamics 
# Collision Geometry
---
> Molecules **must collide** in order to react.
> Even if there is enough energy, the [[Orbitals#Orbitals|Orbitals]] of the compounds must be oriented properly in order to react. This is one factor that slows down the reaction rate.
> $\text{rate of reaction} \propto \text{\# of collisions} \times \text{\% of collisions that are oriented correctly}$ 

## Nature of Reactants
Some reactants react faster than others
This is because weaker bonds must be broken in order to form stronger bonds and create a net positive energy. This increases the [[#Activation Energy]]
### Concentration of Reactants
Increasing the concentration increases the frequency of collisions and hence, reaction rate.
### Temperature
![[Temperature and Potential Energy Diagrams#Temperature]]
### Surface Area
Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant will increase the reaction rate. Because the reaction can only occur on the surface of the solid.
### Pressure
$p= \frac{nRT}{V}=[\text{gas}]RT$
rate $\propto$ pressure
## Activation Energy
The **potential energy** required to start a reaction.
It is the energy needed to break weaker bonds in order to form stronger bonds and release net positive energy.

## Rate Law
$\text{rate}\propto[X]^{m}[Y]^{n}$ , $\text{rate}=k[X]^{m}[Y]^{n}$

X,Y are **concentration**
k is the **rate constant**
m,n are the order of the reaction
m+n is the overall order

The rate is proportional to the initial concentration of the reactants raised to some exponent.
### Order of Reaction
The order determines how much a reaction is affected by the concentrations
the sum of the order of the concentrations
> An order 2 reaction will x4 if the concentrations double

### Determining Experimentally
$$\begin{align}
k=& \frac{r_{1}}{[X]^{m}[Y]^{n}}= \frac{r_{2}}{[X]^{m}[Y]^{n}}\\
& \frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}=\frac{[X]^{m}_{2}}{[X]^{m}_{n}}=\left(\frac{[X]_{2}}{[X]_{1}}\right)^{m}\\
m=&\log_{\frac{[X]^{2}}{[X]_{1}}}{\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}} \\
k=&\frac{r}{[X]^{m}[Y]^{n}}
\end{align}$$
