# Competition for Electrons
---
A [[Redox]] reaction can be viewed as a [[#Competition for Electrons]].
$$\ce{X + Y -> X+ + Y-}$$
$X$ is being oxidized to $\ce{X-}$
$Y$ is being reduced to $\ce{Y+}$
$\therefore Y$ is a better [[#Electron Competitor]] than $X$

They can be predicted using a [[Reduction Table]]

## Electron Competitor
---
There is an activity series to how well a chemical [[#Competition for Electrons|Competes]] for [[Electrons]]. It is the same as the [[Activity Series]] but it goes in the opposite direction

---
$$\ce{K + NaCl -> KCl + Na}$$
Potassium was oxidized, lost electrons to Sodium. $\therefore$ **Sodium** is a better [[#Electron Competitor]] than Potassium which makes Potassium more reactive.

## Examples
---
$\ce{Ni + Cu(NO3)2 -> Cu + Ni(NO3)2}$
$\ce{Ni + Cu^{2+} -> Ni^{2+} + Cu}$
Copper is [[Redox#Reduction Reaction|Reduced]] and $\therefore$ Copper is a better electron competitor than Nickel
