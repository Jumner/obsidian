# Electrochemical Cells
---
## Wet Cells
Use a **liquid electrolyte** to allow the flow of [[Electrons]]
## Dry Cells
Use a **paste** to allow the flow of [[Electrons]]
### Examples
> Regular batteries (alkaline -> basic),
---
## Primary Cells
Unable to be reversed / recharged
> Regular batteries
## Secondary Cells
Can be recharged by applying a **reverse voltage** to undo the chemical reactions.
> Car battery, li-ion
## Notation
Single line **|** -> phase or **state change**
Double line **||** -> **salt bridge** / **porous barrier**
Assume concentrations are 1 Molar (1mol/L)
**Anode** on the left, **Cathode** on the right (Internet may be different)
## Half Cell Potentials
The **voltage** is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two materials.
### Hydrogen Half Cell
$\ce{H2 | H+ | Pt}$ 
Usually uses an **acid** (normally **Nitric** acid) in [[#STP]]
**Positive** reduction potential is the **cathode**
**Negative** reduction potential is the **anode**

## Galvanic Cells
Galvanic cells are **Spontaneous**. However, the [[Redox#Reducing agent|Reducing Agent]] needs to donate its electrons to the [[Redox#Oxidizing agent|Oxidizing Agent]]. If these electrons cannot flow, **the reaction does not occur**.
### Change to Cell potential
The concentration of ions will affect the voltage of the cell.
Adding more solid will **not** affect the voltage.
Adding more salt will increase the reaction speed and **increase the voltage**.
#### Example
$\ce{Zn_{(s)} + Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}-> Zn^{2+}_{(aq)} + Cu_{(s)} }$
An **increase** of $\ce{Zn_{(s)}}$ or a **decrease** of $\ce{Cu_{(s)}}$ will **not** change the **voltage**.
A **increase** of $\ce{Cu^{2+}}$ or a **decrease** of $\ce{Zn^{2+}}$ will **increase** the **voltage**.

## Electrolytic Cells
Electrolytic cells are not **Spontaneous**. A voltage must be applied between them to force [[Electrons]] to flow from the [[Redox#Reducing agent|Reducing Agent]] to the [[Redox#Oxidizing agent|Oxidizing Agent]]. If these are not **forced**, **the reaction does not occur**
