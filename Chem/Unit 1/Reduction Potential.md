## Wet Cells
Use a **liquid electrolyte** to allow the flow of [[electrons]]
## Dry Cells
Use a **paste** to allow the flow of [[electrons]]
### Examples
> Regular batteries (alkaline -> basic),
---
## Primary Cells
Unable to be reversed / recharged
> Regular batteries
## Secondary Cells
Can be recharged by applying a **reverse voltage** to undo the chemical reactions.
> Car battery, li-ion
## Notation
Single line **|** -> phase or **state change**
Double line **||** -> **salt bridge** / **porous barrier**
Assume concentrations are 1 Molar (1mol/L)
**Anode** on the left, **Cathode** on the right (Internet may be different)
## Half Cell Potentials
The **voltage** is the difference between the reduction potentials of the two materials.
### Example
#todo 
- [ ] make not trash
### Hydrogen Half Cell
$\ce{H2 | H+ | Pt}$ 
Usually uses an **acid** (normally **Nitric** acid) in [[#STP]]
**Positive** reduction potential is the **cathode**
**Negative** reduction potential is the **anode**
# STP
