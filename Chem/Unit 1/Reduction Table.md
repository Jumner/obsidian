# Reduction Table
---
A table that shows the ability for a substance to **Gain** [[Electrons]] || to be reduced || to be an oxidizing agent

## Top
- Very good [[Competition for Electrons#Electron Competitor|Electron Competitor]]
- **Likely** to be reduced
- **Unlikely** to be oxidized
- **Strong** Oxidizing agents
- **Weak** Reducing agents
## Bottom
- Very poor [[Competition for Electrons#Electron Competitor|Electron Competitor]]
- **Unlikely** to be reduced
- **Likely** to be oxidized
- **Weak** Oxidizing agents
- **Strong** Reducing agents

## Examples
---
$\ce{Ag + Ni^{2+} -> NR}$ Silver is higher and therefore, will not be oxidized by nickel
$\ce{Ni + 2Ag+ -> Ni^{2+} + 2Ag}$ Silver is higher and then will be reduced by nickel
