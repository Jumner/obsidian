[[Le Chateliers's Principle#- Change of Pressure Volume|Pressure  Change]] is more interesting because it effectively **increases the concentration of all gasses**. 
## Use the Mol Ratios
When drawing the graphs, if A **reactant** loses **0.5 Molar** and the Mol ratios are 1:1, the **products** will increase by **0.5 Molar**.


# The Haber Process
---
> The Haber process is a reaction that is able to form ammonia with Hydrogen and Nitrogen.
> $$\ce{N2 + 3H2 <=>[Fe2O3] 2NH3}$$
> It works efficiently because the ammonia is condensed out and the remaining gasses are reused.
