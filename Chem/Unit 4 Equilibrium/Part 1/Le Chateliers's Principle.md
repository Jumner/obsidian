#Equilibrium 
# Le Chatelier's Principle

> If any **changes are made** to a system in equilibrium, the system will **oppose** the changes and find a **new equilibrium**.
> 
> Example: Increasing the temperature will cause more endothermic reactions to take place lowering the temperature.

## Changes to Equilibrium
Many factors can effect equilibrium
### - Change of **Concentrations**
Increasing the **concentration of reactants** will cause **more products to be formed**. The following equilibrium will **still** have a **higher concentration of reactants** 
### - Change of **Temperature**
Increasing the **Temperature** will cause [[Thermochemistry#Endothermic|Endothermic]] reactions to be **"Favoured"** which will lower the **temperature** (Again still higher than initial).
Similarly, decreasing the **Temperature** will [[Thermochemistry#Exothermic|Exothermic]] reactions to be **"Favoured"** which will raise the **Temperature**.
### - Change of **Pressure** (Volume)
> This applies only to reactions with **gas reactants or products**

If you **increase the pressure**, **gasses will be reacted** to form non gaseous chemicals.
$\ce{2H2 + O2 -> H2O}$ If this reaction had no activation energy, an **increase in pressure** would cause the **gasses to react into water** to **decrease the pressure**
> An increase in **Pressure** will **"Favour"** the reaction with fewer moles of gas

### - Change of [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalysis]]
[[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalysts]] **DO NOT** effect the equilibrium because they increase the rate of **both forwards, and reverse reactions**. However, it does increase the speed in which it **reaches** equilibrium.
