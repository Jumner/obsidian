#Equilibrium 
# The Equilibrium Constant
---
> The constant that determines the [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium State]] and is only effected by [[#Temperature]]

## Derivation
> Look at the general reaction: (**Only for gas or aquas states**) $$\ce{aA + bB <=>> cC + dD}$$
> Then find the [[Collision Geometry#Rate Law|Rate Law]] for both the forward and reverse reactions
> $$\begin{align}
r_{f}&=k_{f}[A]^{a}[B]^{b}\\
r_{r}&=k_{r}[C]^{c}[D]^d
\end{align}$$
> In [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]], the rate of each of the reactions are equal. $\therefore$
> $k_{f}[A]^{a}[B]^{b}=k_{r}[C]^{c}[D]^d$
> $$\begin{align}
\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}&=\frac{[C]^{c}[D]^d}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}\\\\
K&=\frac{[C]^{c}[D]^d}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}
\end{align}$$
> If $K > 1$, then $k_{f}>k_{r}$ which means that the **forward reaction is favoured**
> If $K<1$, then $k_{r}>k_{f}$ which means that the **reverse reaction is favoured**
> If $K=1$, then the **rates are equal** and **no reaction is favoured**
> K **cannot be $<0$** because that would mean that one of the rates is negative which makes no sense.

## Temperature
> Temperature changes the [[#The Equilibrium Constant]].
> The quick way to think about this is: $\dot{K}\propto \dot{T}\Delta H$ (**They only share the same sign**). With a **Temperature increase**, If $\Delta H<0$ ([[Thermochemistry#Exothermic|Exothermic]]), **K will decrease**. If $\Delta H > 0$ ([[Thermochemistry#Endothermic|Endothermic]]), **K will Increase**
 ### Why Though
> If the reaction is [[Thermochemistry#Exothermic|Exothermic]], an increase in **temperature** will **lower** $K$ because the concentration of products **decreases** and the concentration of reactants **increases**. Just refer to the equation: $K=\frac{\text{prod}}{\text{react}}$

## Example
$\ce{2HI_{(0.75M)} <=> H2_{(0.5M)} + I2_{(0.5M)}}$ 
If the $K_{eq}=0.25$ (K value at equilibrium)
Solve for [[#Reaction Quotient|Q]]
$Q=\frac{0.5\cdot0.5}{0.75^{2}}=0.\bar{4}$
$Q > K$ so [[#Reaction Quotient|Reactants are formed]]
Q must decrease so products must decrease and reactants increase.

# Reaction Quotient
---
> The [[#Reaction Quotient]] ($Q$) is very similar to the [[#The Equilibrium Constant]] except it is not limited by the **states of the reactants and products**. It allows you to determine how the system changes with factors other than [[#Temperature]]
> $$Q=\frac{[C]^{c}[D]^d}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}$$
> If $Q=K$, The system is at [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]
> If $Q > K$,  There are too many products, so the **reverse reaction will be favoured** and reactants are formed
> If $Q < K$, There are too many reactants, so the **forward reaction will be favoured** and products are formed
