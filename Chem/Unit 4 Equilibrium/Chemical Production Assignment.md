This paper will describe the optimization of the production of nitrogen monoxide from Ammonia and oxygen. Nitrogen monoxide, also known as nitric oxide is a free radical compound formed by a nitrogen atom double bonded to a oxygen atom. Nitric oxide is a colourless gas with a very sharp odour [^1]. It boils at around -152$\degree$C and melts at around -164$\degree$C [^1]. It is somewhat soluble in water with a solubility of roughly 7.4ml/100ml of water [^1].
## Applications Of Nitrogen Monoxide
There are many applications of Nitrogen Monoxide. The main use is as a precursor to Nitric acid [^3]. The world requires a significant amount of nitric acid for fertilizer and explosive production [^4]. One other use is as the precursor to Dinitrogen Tetroxide ($\ce{N2O4}$). Dinitrogen Tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in rocketry because of its hypergolic reaction with hydrasine[^5]. It is frequently used in reaction control thrusters and sometimes as the main fuel for a few orbital rockets due the simplicity of ignition. 

## Production Of Nitrogen Monoxide
Nitrogen Monoxide is produced using a reaction with Ammonia and Oxygen gas. This reaction is an exothermic equilibrium reaction. Following is the balanced chemical equation:
	$\ce{4NH3_{(g)} + 5O2_{(g)} <=> 4NO_{(g)} + 6H2O_{(g)}}, \Delta H=-900\text{kJ/mol}$   
Both entropy and enthalpy are favoured by the forward reaction.
This means that $K$ will be very large
$$K=\frac{[\ce{NO_{(g)}}]^{4}[\ce{H2O_{(g)}}]^{6}}{[\ce{NH3_{(g)}}]^{4}[\ce{O2_{(g)}}]^{5}}$$
## Improving Production Rate
### Concentration
In order to increase the reaction rate, the concentration of the reactants should be increased. This concentration change will decrease the reaction quotient. In order to restore equilibrium, the reaction will shift right and form products in order to restore equilibrium.
### Temperature
### Pressure
### Other Recommendations
