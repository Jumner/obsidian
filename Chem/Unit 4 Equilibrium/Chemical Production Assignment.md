# Optimization of The Production of Nitrogen Monoxide from Ammonia and Oxygen
---
This paper will describe the optimization of the production of nitrogen monoxide from Ammonia and oxygen. Nitrogen monoxide, also known as nitric oxide is a compound formed by a nitrogen atom double bonded to a oxygen atom. Nitric oxide is a colourless gas with a very sharp odour [^1]. It boils at around -152$\degree$C and melts at around -164$\degree$C [^1]. It is somewhat soluble in water with a solubility of roughly 7.4ml/100ml of water [^1].
