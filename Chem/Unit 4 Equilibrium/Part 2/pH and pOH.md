#Equilibrium 
# pH and pOH
---
## pH
> Stands for **power of <s>hydrogen</s> [[Hydronium#Hydronium|Hydronium]]**
## pOH
> Stands for **power of hydroxide**

## Calculations
> The pH is equal to $-\log{[\ce{H3O+}]}=-\log{[\ce{H+}]}$
> The pOH is equal to $-\log[\ce{OH-}]$

### Switching from One to Another
> [[Hydronium#^078137|Remember that]] $K_{w}=[\ce{H3O+}][\ce{OH-}]=10^{-14}$
> $\therefore 10^{-14}=[\ce{H3O+}]x, x=\frac{10^{-14}}{[\ce{H3O+}]}$
> or pH + pOH = 14
