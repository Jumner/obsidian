#Equilibrium 
# Acids And Bases
---
## Acids
- Sour
- Watery Feel
- Electrolyte
- Reacts with Metals to make $\ce{H2}$
- Formed by Non-metal Oxides in Water
- Litmus turns red
## Bases
- Can be Insoluble
- Bitter
- Soapy Feel
- Electrolyte
- Formed by Metal Oxides in water
- Litmus turns blue
## Bronsted-Lowry
> This theory says that [[#Acids]] Donate **$\ce{H+}$** and [[#Bases]] Receive $\ce{H+}$
> This creates $\ce{H3O+}$ ([[Hydronium#Hydronium|Hydronium]]) and $\ce{OH-}$ (Hydroxide)

### Conjugate Acid and Base
> After the **Acid** donates its $\ce{H+}$, it becomes negative and becomes a **Conjugate Base**. Once a **Base** accepts an $\ce{H+}$ it becomes a **Conjugate Acid**

### Amphoteric
> A chemical that **acts like an acid or base** but is not
> For example water here:

## Lewis Acids and Bases
> Acids receive an electron pair and has a nonfull octet. 
> Bases donate an electron pair and has lone pairs.

## Strong Vs Weak
> A strong acid is one that fully disassociates, All the hydrogens contribute to its acidity.
> For example, the methyl group in vinegar ($\ce{CH3COOH}$) does not disassociate.
