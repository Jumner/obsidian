#Equilibrium 
# Salts
---
> When a salt disassociates, it can create ions that are [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acids or Bases]]. Or they can create a **common ion effect**.
> However, these are likely [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Stupid Weak]]

## Ions Of Strong Bases
> The ions of strong bases do not react with water and are neutral (like Sodium, Potassium, etc...)

## Ions Of Weak Acids and Bases
> The ions of [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acids]] form [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] causing the [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acids or Bases]] to significantly effect the [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]].

## Combination Of Acidic and Basic Ions
> When they are combined, look at the constants and see which one is stronger.
