#Equilibrium 
# Solubility Equilibrium
---
> Solubility is the amount of **solute** that can dissolve into a **solvent**.
> This is actually an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]! At a point in time, some solute is dissolving and some is crystallizing out of solution. The rates of these two **are equal at equilibrium**.
## Solids Dissolving in Liquids
> **Energy is Required** to dissolve
> [[Thermochemistry#Enthalpy|Enthalpy]] is minimized so it will favour **crystallization**
> [[Entropy#Entropy|Entropy]] is maximized so it will favour **dissolution**
> This means that items will usually be **more soluble at higher temperature** because high temp favours [[Entropy#Entropy|Entropy]]

## Gasses Dissolving in Liquids
>**Energy is Released** to dissolve
>[[Thermochemistry#Enthalpy|Enthalpy]] is minimized so it will favour **dissolution**
>[[Entropy#Entropy|Entropy]] is maximized so it will favour **The Gas**
> This means that they will be **less soluble at higher temperature**
