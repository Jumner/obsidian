#Equilibrium 
# Titrations
---
> A titration is a reaction where you add a known amount of a [[#Titrant]] to an unknown concentration of a substance. You then look for the [[#End Point]] because it's close to the [[#Equivalence Point]]

## Equivalence Point
> The point when the reaction is stochiometric.
> It is often hard to detect the [[#End Point]] so the [[#Equivalence Point]] is used instead

## End Point
> The point when an indicator tells us that we are at or past the [[#Equivalence Point]] 

## Titrant
> The chemical of known concentration. This chemical has been **Standardized** so that the concentration is known.

## Titration Curve
> The curve of [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]] through a [[#Titrations|Titration]]. Shows the [[#Equivalence Point]].

## Buffer Solution
> A buffer is a solution with a [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acid]], or a [[Weak Bases#Weak Bases|Weak Base]]. This creates a more gradual [[#Titration Curve]] because the weak acid will slowly disassociate over the whole [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]] range.
## Examples
### Diprotic Acid
> how much 0.2M $\ce{NaOH}$ to titrate 0.025mL of 0.08M $\ce{H2SO4}$ 
> $$\begin{align}
v_{1}c_{1}&=v_{2}c_{2}\\
v_{1}&=\frac{2v_{2}c_{2}}{c_{1}}\\
&=20\text{mL}
\end{align}$$
> Though the second hydrogen is a [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acid]] but at the equivalence point, all of them disassociate.
### Weak Acid - Strong Base

> $$\begin{align}
\ce{1.8\cdot10^{-5}&=\frac{[CH3COO-][H3O+]}{[CH3COOH]}}\\
x^{2}&=\ce{1.8\cdot10^{-5}[CH3COOH-\cancel{x}]} (\frac{0.1}{1.8\cdot10^{-5}}>100,\therefore\text{simplify})\\
x&=0.00134\\
pH&=2.872\\
\end{align}$$
