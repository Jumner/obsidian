#Equilibrium 
# Weak Bases
---
> A weak base is one that does not fully disassociate.
> These bases often don't even include hydroxide. Like $\ce{NH3}$ 
> The [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Base]] of a [[Weak Acids#Weak Acids|Weak Acid]] is also a [[#Weak Bases|Weak Base]].
## Finding Ionization %
> To find the ionization % all you do is divide the concentration of [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acid]] by the concentration of the Base. You will often use [[pH and pOH#pH|pH]].
> **Decreases** as concentration **increases**

## Base Ionization Constant
> There is an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] between the [[Acids And Bases#Bases|Base]] and its [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acid]] 
> $$K_{b}=\frac{[\ce{CA-}][\ce{OH-}]}{[\ce{B}]}$$
> B - [[Acids And Bases#Bases|Base]] 
> CA - [[Acids And Bases#Conjugate Acid and Base|Conjugate Acid]]
> The **larger the $K_{b}$**, the **stronger the base**

## Polyprotic Acids
> An acid with more than one proton. Or more than one **hydrogen that can disassociate**. 
> - Each hydrogen has its own $K_{a}$ value
> - The $K_{a}$ values generally decrease with each proton
