## Valence
- The amount of **electrons** in the outer valence shell.

## Naming binary compounds
### Metal nonmetal
2 chemicals must have opposite [[#Valence]] charges.
### Nonmetals (Greek)
- Mono, Di, Tri, Tetra, Penta, Hexa, Hepta, Octa, Nona, Deca
- Mono ignored on front
- Uses covalent bonds
### Peroxides
- Has an extra oxide than should be expected
### Binary acids
- Hydrogen bonded to another nonmetal
- Named hydro...ic acid (ex hydrochloric acid)
### Bases
- Contain **hydroxide** for the most part

## Polyatomic naming
- Ending is **not** changed

### Acid salts
- uses greek
- when a hydrogen is replaced by another anion
## Hydrates
- Contain a dot in the formula which separates the compound from water
- contains water in its structure. 
- Uses greek
- $\ce{Na2CO3 \cdot 10H2O ->}$ Sodium carbonate decahydrate

## Elements
- Noble gases are monatomic (they are alone)
- Other gases are diatomic (2 bind to eachother)

## Transition metals
Transition metals have multiple [[#Valence]] charges

## Oxidation states
**-Ate** **-Ic** -> higher charge
**-Ite** **-Ous** -> lower charge

## Types of reactions
- Synthesis -> A + B -> AB
- Decomposition -> AB -> A + B
- Single displacement -> A + BX -> B + AX
- Double displacement -> AB + CD -> AD + CB
	- Precipitation
	- neutralization
	- Gas formation
- Combustion -> $\ce{CxHy + O2 -> CO2 + H2O}$

2Ca + O2 -> CaO}$
$\ce{2Ag2O -> 4Ag + O2}$
$\ce{Zn + Pb(NO3)2 -> Pb + Zn(NO3)2}$
Neutralization
$\ce{NaOH + HBr -> H2O + NaBr}$
Precipitation
$\ce{Na2CO3 + CuSO4 -> Na2SO4(aq) + CuCO3(s)}$
Combustion
$\ce{4Na + O2 -> 2Na2O}$
