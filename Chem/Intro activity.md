Hey, I'm **Justin** (he/him).

1. Why are you taking this course?
> I'm taking this course because I need it for university. However, I love chemistry and I would have taken it regardless. There is just so fascinating about predicting and understanding chemical reactions.

2. What are some general goals you have for yourself in this course?
> Recently, I've been trying to overhaul my study habits. So I want to be able get a really good intuitive understanding of the material (Which has never been an issue for me), but also get a mark that I feel represents me.

3. What is something you like to do in your free time?
> I'm a huge nerd and I like learning stuff in my free time. As an example, I remember in grade 10, learning about orbitals and stoichiometry. Of course, I also like hanging out with my friends.

4. Do you know which career you'd like to pursue / post secondary program you'd like to attend?
> I would love to go to Waterloo for mechatronics engineering and then either directly go into control systems engineering, or move to america and get a masters/PhD.

5. Is there anything else about you that you'd like me to know?
> I tend to need a lot of clarification on assignments and labs. I thought I would just give you a heads up.
