# Nested Sidechains
---
> What happens when a sidechain has sidechains?
> You use brackets
> For example, if you have a methyl group with a chlorine attached to hexane at carbon 2, you get 2-(1-chloromethyl)hexane 

## Isopropyl
> Since (**1-methylethyl**) groups pop up everywhere, they have a special name **Isopropyl**. Another way to write this is as a propyl group joined at carbon 2. This is written as prop-2-yl
