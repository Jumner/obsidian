## Boiling Point
> It depends on the [[Solids#Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Forces]]
> Because [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbons]] are [[Polarity#Polarity|Non-Polar]] they have low **boiling points** which slightly increase with length because of [[Solids#London Dispersion Force LDF|LDF]].

> [[Hydrocarbons#Cis Vs Trans Isomers|Trans Isomers]] have a lower boiling point than [[Hydrocarbons#Cis Vs Trans Isomers|Cis Isomers]] because they are harder to pack (She says its bc of [[Polarity#Polarity|Polarity]]).

> [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar]] [[Groups#Groups|Functional Groups]] create [[Solids#Hydrogen Bonding|Hydrogen Bonds]] -> High boiling point

## Volatility
> How much a chemical can evaporate at low temperature
> the weaker the forces, the higher the [[#Volatility]]

## Uses
> [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Keytones]] -> Solvents
> [[Groups#Alcohols|Alcohols]] -> Disinfectants
> [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkenes|Alkenes]] -> Monomers for addition polymers
> [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Aldehydes]] -> Scents
> [[Groups#Amide|Amide]] -> Proteins and condensation polymers
> [[Groups#Ester|Ester]] -> Fruit
> [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] -> Fuel
> [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxylic Acids]] -> Vinegar
