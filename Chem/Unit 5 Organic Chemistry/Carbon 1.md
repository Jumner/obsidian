# Carbon 1
---
> Carbon one is super important. So make sure to pick it correctly
## Order of Priority
1. Start at the [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Aldehydes]] nearest [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Ketones]].
2. Triple Bonds. Always start closest to the triple bond
3. Double Bonds. Always start closest to the double bond
4. Start in a position where the sum of the occupied carbon numbers is the lowest.
> $\ce{CH3 CH3 C(2CH3) CH2 CH(CH3) CH3}$ starts at the right (2+4) vs (3+5)
