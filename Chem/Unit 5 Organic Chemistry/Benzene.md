---
> Benzene is the most important [[Hydrocarbons#Aromatic|Aromatic Hydrocarbon]] 
> ![[Pasted image 20220531083339.png]]
> Despite that there are **3 single** and **3 double** bonds **at any given moment**, we are taught to think over a **longer time period** where there are **6 1.5 bonds** 
> 1-nitrobenzene simplifies to just nitrobenzene because the position is implied.

## OMP Naming
>![[Pasted image 20220531085812.png]]
> This means that 
> 1,2 dinitrobenzene -> ortho-dinitrobenzene
> 1,3 dinitrobenzene -> meta-dinitrobenzene
> 1,4 dinitrobenzene -> para-dinitrobenzene

## Phenol
> Phenol is a common molecule with a **hydroxyl group on carbon 1**
> ![[Pasted image 20220531084154.png]]
> Instead of hydroxybenzene its just phenol
