> Despite that there are **3 single** and **3 double** bonds **at any given moment**, we are taught to think over a **longer time period** where there are **6 1.5 bonds** 
> 1-nitrobenzene simplifies to just nitrobenzene because the position is implied.

## Phenol
> Phenol is a common molecule with a **hydroxyl group on carbon 1**

> Instead of hydroxybenzene its just phenol

## OMP Naming

> This means that 
> 1,2 dinitrobenzene -> ortho-dinitrobenzene
> 1,3 dinitrobenzene -> meta-dinitrobenzene
> 1,4 dinitrobenzene -> para-dinitrobenzene
