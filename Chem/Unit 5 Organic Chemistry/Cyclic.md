# Cyclic
> Cyclic [[Hydrocarbons#Aliphatic|Aliphatic Hydrocarbons]] are like the standard chain but they are joined into a cycle. This violates the normal rules for finding the **backbone** and the ring is the backbone
> For example 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane is a ring of 6 carbons with 2 methyl groups
> This makes benzene cyclohex-1,3,5-ene

## Example
