## Carbonyl
> A carbonyl group is a carbon with a double bonded oxygen.
> ![[Pasted image 20220601092420.png]]
> This makes the **Ketones** which end in **One** like Propan**one** 
> There are many groups derived by it

### Aldehydes And Ketones
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a hydrogen creates an **Aldehyde**
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with 2 [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chains]] creates a **Ketone** 
> ![[Pasted image 20220601092809.png]]
> **Al**dehydes end in **Al**. For example Methan**al** or formaldehyde.
> Ket**one**s end in **One**. For example Propan**one** (acetone).
> 
> Another way to think of this is if the double bond is **at the end** of the chain its an **Aldehyde**, if its in **the middle**, its a **Ketone**

### Ester
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a single bonded oxygen creates an **Ester**
> ![[Pasted image 20220601093441.png]]
> In biology, **ester bonds** are formed between a [[#Hydroxyl]] and a [[#Carboxyl]] via **dehydration synthesis**

### Carboxyl
> A carboxyl group is a [[#Carbonyl]] group with a [[#Hydroxyl]] group. This creates the **Carboxyl group**
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085205.png]]
> The hydrogen on the hydroxide disassociates and makes it acidic.
> When it is bound to another structure, it becomes an acid and ends in **oic acid**.
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] you get [[Benzene#Benzoic Acid|Benzoic Acid]] 

### Amide
> A [[#Carbonyl]] group with a [[#amino]] group
> ![[Pasted image 20220601093419.png]]
## Amino
> The amino group is a nitrogen and 2 hydrogens.
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085304.png]]
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] it becomes [[Benzene#Analine|Analine]]

## Methyl
> The methyl group is a carbon and 3 hydrogens
> ![[Pasted image 20220531085709.png]]
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] its called [[Benzene#Toluene|Toluene]]

## Hydroxyl
> The hydroxyl group is a **hydroxide**
> ![[Pasted image 20220601090516.png]]
### Alcohols
> These create the **Alcohols** and end in **ol**. Eg methan**ol** you actually put the number in between **methan-1-ol** becomes methanol. Because there is **one carbon** bound the the **alcohols carbon**, it's called a **primary alcohol**
> With [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] its called [[Benzene#Phenol|Phenol]]

### Polarity
> The [[#Hydroxyl]] groups is super [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar]] and it makes alcohols **polar**.
> This **[[Polarity#Polarity|Polarity]] decreases** as the **size increases**.

## Phenyl
> Though [[Benzene#Phenol|Phenol]] is a compound on its own. When [[Benzene#Benzene|Benzene]] is a [[Side Chain#Side Chain|Side Chain]] it is called Phenyl.
