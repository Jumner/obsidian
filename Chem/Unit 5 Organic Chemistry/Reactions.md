# Reactions
---
> There are a few different reactions that can occur with [[Organic Chemistry#Organic Chemistry|Organic Molecules]].
>![[Pasted image 20220614090257.png]]
## Combustion
> Because of the hydrogen content, most [[Organic Chemistry#Organic Chemistry|Organic Molecules]] are **highly flammable**
> This combustion has the formula
> $\ce{C_{x}H_{y} + (x + \frac{y}{2})O2 -> (x)CO2 + (\frac{y}{2})H2O}$  
## Substitution
> **[[#Halogens]]** can replace the hydrogens in the [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]] called **Halogenation**.
> The reason they are replaced is because [[#Halogens|Halogen]] ions are super reactive. They are formed from UV light or heat.
> These go one hydrogen at a time because it forms $\ce{HCl}$

### Haloalkanes
> Halo[[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] are [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] with substituted [[#Halogens]]

### [[Hydrocarbons#Aromatic|Aromatics]]
> Aromatics undergo the same process but it requires a [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalyst]].
>![[Pasted image 20220602215419.png]]
## Unsaturated 
> Unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbons]] ([[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkenes|Alkenes]], [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkynes|Alkynes]]) are far more reactive because of their double/triple bonds.
> This allows one halogen gas to **replace** **two** hydrogens instead of just one. Also **at room temperature**

### Bromine Test
> To find if a [[Hydronium#Hydronium|Hydrocarbon]] is saturated or not, add a bit bromine. If the water clears up, the bromine reacted and its unsaturated.

### Hydrogenation
> Hydrogen can also insert itself and **saturate the hydrocarbon**. However, this requires heat, pressure, and a [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Platinum Catalyst]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220016.png]]

### Hydrohalogenation
> When a halogen acid ($\ce{HCl, HBr}$) reacts with an unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]] to insert both the hydrogen **and** the halogen
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220052.png]]

#### Dehydrohalogenation
> This is an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]] so to make it go in reverse, add a strong base to neutralize the acid.
> ![[Pasted image 20220602225040.png]]
### Hydration
> Also called hydro**lysis** (water break down)
> When a water molecule inserts a hydrogen and a [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] group into the unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]].
> Note: This requires an [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Acid Catalyst]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220311.png]]

#### Dehydration
> This reaction can also go in reverse. But it requires some form of [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalyst]]
> ![[Pasted image 20220602222009.png]]
## Markovnikov’s Rule
> If there are more than one position in the reaction, the **more electronegative group** will bond to the carbon with the **fewest** **hydrogens**.
> Hydrogen will usually just join its comrades.
> Like my [[Soup Model#Soup Model|Soup Model]] predicts, it does both but most product follow [[#Markovnikov’s Rule|The Rule]]
> ![[Pasted image 20220602221901.png]] 

### Major Product
> The [[#Major Product]] is the **product that follows [[#Markovnikov’s Rule]]**.
> It forms the **Majority** of products

### Minor Product
> The [[#Minor Product]] is the **product that <u>Doesn't</u> follow [[#Markovnikov’s Rule]]**
> It is **much less common** than the [[#Major Product]].
## Mild Oxidation
> Full oxidation is simply [[#Combustion]]. But partial oxidation can also occur. These are caused by agents like $\ce{KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, PCC, H2O2}$ , Usually the latter.
> ![[Pasted image 20220602225401.png]]
> 1st degree [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Alcohols]] turn into [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Aldehydes]] (oxygen goes to double bonded) then a [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] replaces the hydrogen to get to a [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxylic Acid]]
> 2nd degree [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Alcohols]] turn into [[Groups#Aldehydes And Ketones|Ketones]] (actually [[Groups#Acetyl|Acetyl]])
> 3rd degree don't react (carbon carbon bonds are strong)
### Reduction
> The opposite of oxidation is reduction. These require a reducing agent like $\ce{NaBH4,LiAlH4}$.
> They convert [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxyl]] to [[Groups#Carbonyl|Carbonyl]] then to [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]].
## Condensation
> Condensation reactions, like [[#Dehydration]] remove a hydrogen and [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] group to release water.

### Two [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Alcohols]]
> Two Alcohols can combine to form an [[Groups#Ether|Ether]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220604183052.png]]
### [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Alcohol]] And [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxylic Acid]]
> The [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] of the [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxyl]] reacts with another [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] to create an [[Groups#Ester|Ester]]. This reaction is also an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220604183215.png]]
### [[Groups#Amino|Amine]] And [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxylic Acid]]
> One of the [[Groups#Amino|Aminos]] hydrogens can react with the [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] of the [[Groups#Carboxyl|Carboxyl]]. This reaction is also an [[Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium]]
> ![[Pasted image 20220604183612.png]]
## [[Groups#Amino|Amine]] Synthesis
> [[Groups#Amino|Amines]] can be formed by a [[#Haloalkanes]] reacting with **Ammonia**.
> ![[Pasted image 20220604190551.png]]
> They can also be formed from primary or secondary amines
> ![[Pasted image 20220604191438.png]]
## Halogens
> Halogens are the group containing Chlorine, Bromine, etc...
> They can replace the hydrogens because they both are missing one [[Electrons#Electrons|Electron]] from their valence.
