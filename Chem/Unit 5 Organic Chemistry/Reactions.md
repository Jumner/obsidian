# Reactions
---
> There are a few different reactions that can occur with [[Organic Chemistry#Organic Chemistry|Organic Molecules]].

## Combustion
> Because of the hydrogen content, most [[Organic Chemistry#Organic Chemistry|Organic Molecules]] are **highly flammable**
> This combustion has the formula
> $\ce{C_{x}H_{y} + (x + \frac{y}{2})O2 -> (x)CO2 + (\frac{y}{2})H2O}$  
## Substitution
> **[[#Halogens]]** can replace the hydrogens in the [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]] called **Halogenation**.
> The reason they are replaced is because [[#Halogens|Halogen]] ions are super reactive. They are formed from UV light or heat.
> These go one hydrogen at a time because it forms $\ce{HCl}$

### Haloalkanes
> Halo[[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] are [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkanes|Alkanes]] with substituted [[#Halogens]]

### [[Hydrocarbons#Aromatic|Aromatics]]
> Aromatics undergo the same process but it requires a [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalyst]].
>![[Pasted image 20220602215419.png]]
### Unsaturated 
> Unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbons]] ([[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkenes|Alkenes]], [[Alkanes, Alkenes, and Alkynes#Alkynes|Alkynes]]) are far more reactive because of their double/triple bonds.
> This allows one halogen gas to **replace** **two** hydrogens instead of just one. Also **at room temperature**

#### Hydrogenation
> Hydrogen can also insert itself and **saturate the hydrocarbon**. However, this requires heat, pressure, and a [[Catalysts#Catalysts|Catalyst]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220016.png]]
#### Hydrohalogenation
> When a halogen acid ($\ce{HCl, HBr}$) reacts with an unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]] to insert both the hydrogen **and** the halogen
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220052.png]]
#### Hydration
> When a water molecule inserts a hydrogen and a [[Groups#Hydroxyl|Hydroxyl]] group indo the unsaturated [[Hydrocarbons#Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]].
> ![[Pasted image 20220602220311.png]]

##### Dehydration
> This reaction can also go in reverse.

### Markovnikovâ€™s Rule
> If there are more than one position in the reaction, the **more electronegative group** will bond to the carbon with the **fewest** **hydrogens**.
> ![[Pasted image 20220602221901.png]] 
### Halogens
> Halogens are the group containing Chlorine, Bromine, etc...
> They can replace the hydrogens because they both are missing one [[Electrons#Electrons|Electron]] from their valence.
