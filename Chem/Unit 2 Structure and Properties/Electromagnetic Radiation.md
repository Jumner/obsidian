# Electromagnetic Radiation
Also known as light, these 2 perpendicular waves travel at the speed of light in a vaccuum.

## Wavelength
$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$ 
**Wavelength** (m) = **speed of light** / [[Energy and Frequency#Photon Frequency|Frequency]]
## Visible Light
The light that we can see is from **400**nm (**purple**) to **700**nm (**red**)
