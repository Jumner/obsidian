# Bohr Model
---
The [[Bohr Model]] is a model of the [[Atom]] developed by **Bohr Rutherford**.

# Energy Levels
---
Also known as **Orbits**
When [[Electrons]] are exited, they will drop down and release [[Photon|Photons]] of a specific [[Electromagnetic Radiation#Wavelength|Wavelength]]. 
## Calculating the energy of an [[#Energy Levels|Energy Level]]
$E_{n} = \frac{-1312}{n^{2}}\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{mol}}$
-1312 is for **Hydrogen**
Therefore, to find the **change in energy**
$\Delta E_{n} = E_{f} - E_{i}$ Energy **final** - Energy **Initial**
$\therefore \Delta E_{n} = \frac{-1312}{n_{f}^{2}} - \frac{-1312}{n_{i}^{2}}$ 
## The Rydberg formula
$\frac{1}{\lambda} = $
