## Polar Covalent Bond
A Polar Covalent bond occurs when the difference in **Electronegativity** is greater than 0.5 and less than 1.7. The [[Electrons]] will be pulled towards the atom with the **higher** electronegativity, making it negative, and forming [[#Dipoles]].
### Dipoles
[[#Dipoles]] are formed with [[#Polar Covalent Bond|Polar Covalent Bonds]]. The element with higher **Electronegativity** will pull the [[Electrons]] closer making it **Partially** negative. This creates 2 [[#Dipoles]] $\delta^{+}$ and $\delta^{-}$ 
## Molecular Polarity
Only exist in **Diatomic Molecules** because there is only one bond. The [[#Polarity]] of the **molecule** is the same as the [[#Polarity]] of the bond.
### Example
$\ce{F_{2}-> F-F}$
$\ce{HCl -> H\delta+-Cl\delta-}$
