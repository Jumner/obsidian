## Lewis Theory of Bonding
- **Noble gases** are most stable because of their [[Periodic Trends#First Ionization Energy|First IE]].
- Stable octets can be formed by transferring [[Electrons]]
- **Sharing** [[Electrons]] leads to **covalent bonds**
Each **element** can hold up to 2n$^{2}$ [[Electrons]] in their **valence**
### Limitations
Treats everything as particles and not waves.
does not address [[Orbitals]]
## Free Radical
> Something with unpaired [[Electrons]]
- Hydroxide ($\ce{OH-}$) Vs. **Hydroxyl** radical ($\ce{OH}$)
## Resonance
> When more than one [[#Lewis Theory of Bonding|Lewis]] structure is possible.
> Mix ups between single and double bonds can be shown as **2 1.5 bonds** which are **dashed**.

A good example of this is [[Benzene]]

## Valence Bond Theory
Addresses the **quantum aspect**.
**Covalent bonds** form when 2 half filled [[Orbitals]] overlap to form a bond.
These bonds will have 2 [[Electrons]] with opposite [[Orbitals#Magnetic Spin Quantum Number ms|Spin]].
> This overlap is called a **$\sigma$ (sigma) bond**
### $\sigma$ Bond
> Only one can occur between 2 atoms
### $\pi$ Bond
> Bonds that occur alongside a [[#sigma Bond|Sigma Bond]], with [[Orbitals#P Orbital|P Orbitals]]
