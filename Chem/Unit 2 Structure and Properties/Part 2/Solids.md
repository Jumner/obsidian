## Intramolecular Forces
> The **Internal** forces that hold the **molecule** together which affect the **chemical properties**.
These are the **bonds** that determine the bond energy of the molecule.
## Intermolecular Forces
> The forces **Between** molecules which affect the **physical properties**
These are the **bonds** that are broken which cause a substance to **melt or boil**.
### Dipole Dipole Bonding
The bonds formed from the attraction between [[Polarity#Dipoles|Dipoles]] of a [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar Molecule]]
### Hydrogen Bonding
> **Strongest [[#Intermolecular Forces]]**

When the **Partial positive** charge that hydrogen has in a [[Polarity#Polar Covalent Bond|Polar Covalent Bond]] attracts to the **Partial negative** charge of another element (Usually **oxygen** in **water**, **Florine**, or **Nitrogen**). Represented with a dashed line.
### London Dispersion Force (LDF)
> **Super weak** attraction force.
> Caused by the **temporary** [[Polarity#Dipoles|Dipoles]] formed as [[Electrons]] **move around** in the elements.
> As 2 molecules come together, these **line up** and form a **small attraction**.
> Responsible for the low **melting** and **boiling** of [[#Atomic Solids|Noble Gasses]] and [[#Non Polarity Polarity Polar|Non Polar Molecules]].

Increases as the # of [[Electrons]] Increases.

## Atomic Solids
> **Noble Gasses**

## Molecular Solids
> Covalent Bonds
### Non [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar]]
> No [[Polarity#Dipoles|Dipoles]] so no [[#Dipole Dipole Bonding]]
> **Only** have [[#London Dispersion Force LDF]]
> **Very Low** **Melting** and **Boiling** Points
### Hydrocarbon
> **The larger** the chain, **the stronger** the [[#London Dispersion Force LDF]] and the **higher the melting/boiling** point
### [[Polarity#Polarity|Polar]] Molecules
> The **positive and negative** [[Polarity#Dipoles|Dipoles]] attract and form [[#Dipole Dipole Bonding|Dipole Dipole Bonds]].
> **Much higher** **Melting** and **Boiling** points due to the **much stronger** [[#Dipole Dipole Bonding]]
