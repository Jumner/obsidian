> The trends of the **properties of Elements** in the periodic table

## Electrostatic force
The force between the **nucleus** and the [[Electrons]]
### What affects it
- Lowered by the distance between **nucleus** and [[Electrons]] ([[Bohr Model#Energy Levels|Energy Level]])
- Increased by the number of **protons**
- Lowered by the number of **Electrons** (**Shielding**)
- **Shielding** is the same for all [[Electrons]] in an [[Orbitals|Orbital]]
### Coulomb's law
$$F=k\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}$$
$F$ is force
$q_{1}$ is the **effective charge** (protons - shielding)
$q_{2}$ charge on one [[Electrons]]
$r$ average distance between nucleus and outer [[Electrons]]
## Atomic Radius
Atomic radius cannot be measured directly. Instead they are measured using the distance between 2 bonded atoms
## First Ionization Energy
The energy required to remove an [[Electrons|Electron]] from the furthest [[Orbitals|Orbital]]. They must be a **gas**
$\ce{A_{(g)} + energy -> A+ + e-}$
Notated with $IE_{1}$ 
Increases from **left** to **right**
Decreases from **top** to **bottom**
> The [[#First Ionization Energy]] is what gives **noble gasses** their **stability**
### Further ionization energies
> Further ionization energies are always larger than the [[#First Ionization Energy]]
> Each jump in energy level has a 10x increase in ionization energy
#### Exceptions
Boron is an exception because its $2p^{1}$ is easier to ionize than Beryllium's $2s^{2}$
Similarly, Oxygen is an exception because its $2p^{4}$ is easier to ionize than Nitrogen's $2p^{3}$

## Electron Affinity
The **energy** that is released from adding [[Electrons]] to an atom.
$\ce{A + e- -> A- + energy}$ 
Decreases from **right** to **left**
Increases from **top** to **bottom**
