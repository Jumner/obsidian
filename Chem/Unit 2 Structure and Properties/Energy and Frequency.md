Can be used to calculate [[Electromagnetic Radiation#Wavelength|Wavelength]].
## Planck's Equation
$E = hf$ Energy (per photon (kJ)) = [[#Photon Frequency|Frequency]] times [[Photon#Planck's Constant|Planck's Constant]]
To get the energy per mole, multiply by [[Avogadro's Constant]]
$E = hfN_{A}$ Energy (per mole (kJ)) times [[#Photon Frequency|Frequency]]
