## Mass / Mass
115 g of sugar is disolved in 155g of water. Express the concentration
$$\ce{\% \frac{m}{m} = \frac{m_{solute}}{m_{solution}} = \frac{115g}{115g + 155g} = 42.6\%}$$
## Molarity
mol/L (How many molecules are in one liter of solvent)
> What is the concentration in mol/L of a solution of 49g of sulfuric acid in enough water to produce a 3.0 L solution
$$\ce{M = \frac{n}{\text{v}} = \frac{49\cancel{g}}{98.08\cancel{g}/mol}\cdot\frac{1}{3.0 L}=0.17mol/L}$$
### Dilution
Calculate the concentration of a solution formed by mixing 25.0 mL of 12.0 mol/L HCl with enough water to form a 500 mL solution.
$$\ce{n = M \cdot v = \frac{12.0 \cancel{mL} \cdot 1\cancel{L}}{1000 \cancel{mL}} \cdot25.0 mol/\cancel{L}}=0.3mol$$
$$\ce{M = \frac{n}{\text{v}}= \frac{0.3mol}{0.5 L}=0.6 mol/L}$$
