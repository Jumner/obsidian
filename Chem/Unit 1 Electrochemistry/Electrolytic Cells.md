# Electrolytic Cells
---
They are a type of [[Electrochemical Cells|Electrochemical Cell]] where the **electrodes do not participate** in the reaction. They are often used to create pure elements.
Only occurs with the **nonspontaneous reaction** with the highest voltage potential (**The closest to spontaneous**), and requires electricity.
## Electrodes
In [[#Electrolytic Cells]], the electrodes are **inert** and are usually made of **Platinum** or **Carbon**.
The negative terminal is the a**n**ode and the positive terminal is the cathode.
Electrons flow from **anode** to **cathode**
## Water Example
As electrons are **pulled from the anode**, electrons from **oxygen are pulled away** creating oxygen gas.
As those electrons are **pumped into the cathode**, they are **given to hydrogen** creating hydrogen gas
cathode $\ce{4H2O -> 2H2 + 4OH-}$
anode $\ce{2H2O -> O2 + 4H+}$
$\ce{6H2O -> 2H2 + O2 + (4OH- + 4H+)}$
$\ce{\cancel{6}2H2O -> 2H2 + O2 + \cancel{4H2O}}$
$\ce{2H2O -> 2H2 + O2}$
## Aquas Electrolysis
For each of the possible half reactions, the ones with the **highest voltage potential** will occur. This could be from 2 half reactions from 2 different reactions.
For example **Potassium Iodide**
ox: $\ce{2I- -> I2 + 2e-}$ **-0.54**v
red: $\ce{K+ + e- -> K}$ -2.93v

ox: $\ce{2H2O -> O2 + 4e- + 4H+}$ -1.23v
red: $\ce{2H2O + 2e- -> H2 + 2OH-}$ **-0.83**v
$\therefore$ $\ce{2I- + 2H2O -> I2 + H2 + 2OH-}$ 1.37v

## Overvoltage
Overvoltage (overpotential) is the **difference** between the **predicted** half-cell potential and the **real world** potential.
Can be effected by **Activation Energy**
Usually about **0.5V**
## Electroplating
Using [[Electrolytic Cells|Electrolysis]] to plate a **conductive material** in a metal.
